His name was Dr. Pizzutillo, an Italian American, whose name, apparently, was too difficult for most Americans to pronounce, so he went by Dr. P. And Dr. P always wore really colorful bow ties and had the very perfect disposition to work with children.
I hated them. And, you know, I was already bargaining, as a five year-old child, with Dr. P to try to get out of doing these exercises, unsuccessfully, of course.
Now, of course, this was a simple ploy on Dr. P's part to get me to do the exercises I didn't want to do before the prospect of being the richest five-year-old in the second floor ward, but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me.
And I have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong, powerful and athletic person well into the future.
The human ability to adapt, it's an interesting thing, because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity, and I'm going to make an admission: This phrase never sat right with me, and I always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it, and I think I'm starting to figure out why.
A few years ago, I was in a food market in the town where I grew up in that red zone in northeastern Pennsylvania, and I was standing over a bushel of tomatoes. It was summertime: I had shorts on.
And so my mother's prenatal physician had gone on vacation, so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents.
And, because I was born without the fibula bones, and had feet turned in, and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that, he had to be the bearer — this stranger had to be the bearer of bad news.
He said to me, "I had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk, and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence, and you've been making liar out of me ever since." (Laughter) (Applause)
The extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clippings throughout my whole childhood, whether winning a second grade spelling bee, marching with the Girl Scouts, you know, the Halloween parade, winning my college scholarship, or any of my sports victories, and he was using it, and integrating it into teaching resident students, med students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School.
And there's been a shift in my thinking over time, in that, if you had asked me at 15 years old, if I would have traded prosthetics for flesh-and-bone legs, I wouldn't have hesitated for a second.
But if you ask me today, I'm not so sure.
I'd like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth-century Persian poet named Hafiz that my friend, Jacques Dembois told me about, and the poem is called "The God Who Only Knows Four Words": "Every child has known God, not the God of names, not the God of don'ts, but the God who only knows four words and keeps repeating them, saying, 'Come dance with me.
It's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches — you know, when the doctor asks, "Does it hurt now when I touch you here?" And then there is a remembering self, and the remembering self is the one that keeps score, and maintains the story of our life, and it's the one that the doctor approaches in asking the question, "How have you been feeling lately?" or "How was your trip to Albania?" or something like that.
Clearly, Patient B suffered more — his colonoscopy was longer, and every minute of pain that Patient A had, Patient B had, and more.
I'm a Lance Armstrong fan, so I'll go ahead and I'll click on that, which reveals, for me, all the issues in which Lance Armstrong's been a part of.
And I was always absorbed in a book, science fiction book, which took my mind to other worlds, and satisfied, in a narrative form, this insatiable sense of curiosity that I had.
You know, I was a real science geek.
And I was an artist. I could draw. I could paint. And I found that because there weren't video games and this saturation of CG movies and all of this imagery in the media landscape, I had to create these images in my head.
I was endlessly getting busted in math class doodling behind the textbook.
I still, to this day, stand in absolute awe of what I see when I make these dives.
But when I chose a career as an adult, it was filmmaking.
And I was, as a kid, constantly drawing comic books, and so on.
So, I started a company with Stan Winston, my good friend Stan Winston, who is the premier make-up and creature designer at that time, and it was called Digital Domain.
So, I was completely smitten by this, and had to do more.
After the success of "Titanic," I said, "OK, I'm going to park my day job as a Hollywood movie maker, and I'm going to go be a full-time explorer for a while." And so, we started planning these expeditions.
So, you know, here I am now, on the deck of Titanic, sitting in a submersible, and looking out at planks that look much like this, where I knew that the band had played.
And it may be a little bit of a glimpse as to what might be happening some decades out as we start to have cyborg bodies for exploration or for other means in many sort of post-human futures that I can imagine, as a science fiction fan.
At the same time I was getting very interested in space science as well — again, it's the science fiction influence, as a kid.
And I wound up getting involved with the space community, really involved with NASA, sitting on the NASA advisory board, planning actual space missions, going to Russia, going through the pre-cosmonaut biomedical protocols, and all these sorts of things, to actually go and fly to the international space station with our 3D camera systems. And this was fascinating. But what I wound up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep.
I'd completely closed the loop between being the science fiction fan, you know, as a kid, and doing this stuff for real.
The day before the event, I called the head of P.R. for the company. Let's call him Don.
I can't, but this guy can. Let's call him Miguel — actually his name is Miguel. (Laughter) And no, he didn't cook the fish, and he's not a chef.
I asked him how he became such an expert on fish.
I'm an expert in relationships. "And then he's off, launching into more talk about rare birds and algaes and strange aquatic plants.
It's great, but I was in love.
I was totally confused.
We're not realists, us foodies; we're lovers.
Look to Miguel, farmers like Miguel. Farms that aren't worlds unto themselves; farms that restore instead of deplete; farms that farm extensively instead of just intensively; farmers that are not just producers, but experts in relationships. Because they're the ones that are experts in flavor, too.
And if I'm going to be really honest, they're a better chef than I'll ever be.
For some time I have been interested in the placebo effect, which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in, unless you think of it in the terms that I do, which is, "Something fake is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real." In other words, sugar pills have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies, the placebo effect, just because the person thinks that what's happening to them is a pharmaceutical or some sort of a — for pain management, for example, if they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect.
I'm not a doctor or a researcher, so this, to me, was an astonishing thing.
I'm Jane McGonigal. I'm a game designer.
Truly. This is a portrait by photographer Phil Toledano.
There's an economist named Edward Castronova.
Not like me, I'm a game designer; I'm exuberant.
One day, Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez was walking along the streets of downtown Los Angeles when he heard beautiful music.
And I'm telling a story that many of you know, because Steve's columns became the basis for a book, which was turned into a movie, with Robert Downey Jr. acting as Steve Lopez, and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers, the Juilliard-trained double bassist whose promising career was cut short by a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia.
And I will always make music with Nathaniel, whether we're at Walt Disney Concert Hall or on Skid Row, because he reminds me why I became a musician. Thank you. (Applause)
I don't know. I'm convinced that there's some sort of pull to nostalgia, to wishful thinking.
I don't want to go back, and it's not because I'm adventurous. It's because possibilities on this planet, they don't go back, they go forward.
A kid born in New Delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did 100 years ago. Think about that, it's an incredible fact.
I mean, I'm a journalist. We type, we file, we go to dinner. It's fine.
This guy was a hero, Jonas Salk.
He took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us.
And they're not just going to die of measles. What about polio? Let's have that. Why not? A college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought I was a little strident.
And they're not just going to die of measles. What about polio? Let's have that. Why not? A college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought I was a little strident.
And he doesn't know that he's infected with a paralytic disease, and we don't either because that's the way the world works.
When I'm not fighting poverty, I'm fighting fires as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company.
I remember my first fire. I was the second volunteer on the scene, so there was a pretty good chance I was going to get in.
When I found the captain, he was having a very engaging conversation with the homeowner, who was surely having one of the worst days of her life.
When I found the captain, he was having a very engaging conversation with the homeowner, who was surely having one of the worst days of her life.
Here it was, the middle of the night, she was standing outside in the pouring rain, under an umbrella, in her pajamas, barefoot, while her house was in flames.
The other volunteer who had arrived just before me — let's call him Lex Luther — (Laughter) got to the captain first and was asked to go inside and save the homeowner's dog. The dog! I was stunned with jealousy.
The other volunteer who had arrived just before me — let's call him Lex Luther — (Laughter) got to the captain first and was asked to go inside and save the homeowner's dog. The dog! I was stunned with jealousy.
Here was some lawyer or money manager who, for the rest of his life, gets to tell people that he went into a burning building to save a living creature, just because he beat me by five seconds.
Well, I was next.
In both my vocation at Robin Hood and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter, I am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale, but I'm also witness to acts of grace and courage on an individual basis.
That means we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother, who lived around six million years ago.
So here, we have a young female and a male engaged in a chase game.
And I want you to see, this is Fuku, a young female, and she is quietly playing with water.
AB: I was 24 years old and at the top of my game when a freak summersault while downhill skiing paralyzed me.
Not long afterwards, a doctor strode into my hospital room, and he said, "Amanda, you'll never walk again." And that was 19 yeas ago.
And I was blown away, because I thought the whole concept, the idea of advertising, was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible, to get as many people to see it as possible.
We want you to tell a story, but we just want to tell our story. "See, when I was a kid and my father would catch me in some sort of a lie — and there he is giving me the look he often gave me — he would say," Son, there's three sides to every story.
But with only one company, one agency willing to help me — and that's only because I knew John Bond and Richard Kirshenbaum for years — I realized that I would have to go on my own, I'd have to cut out the middleman and go to the companies myself with all of my team.
Lawyer: I'm a lawyer brand.
Up attributes are things like being playful, being fresh like the Fresh Prince, contemporary, adventurous, edgy or daring like Errol Flynn, nimble or agile, profane, domineering, magical or mystical like Gandalf. Or are you more of a down attribute?
I have had the distinct blessing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects.
I'm not a programmer, never done anything with ocular recognition technology, but I just recognized something and associated myself with amazing people so that we could make something happen.
That makes me feel very good as a doctor.
The great 20th-century geneticist, T.G. Dobzhansky, who was also a communicant in the Russian Orthodox Church, once wrote an essay that he titled "Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution." Now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution, this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid, take out your personal communications device — I give you permission — and perhaps take another look at Kathryn Schultz's book on being wrong, because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense whatsoever to you. (Laughter) But if you do accept biological evolution, consider this: is it just about the past, or is it about the future?
I was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology.
Standing before him is a gorgeous, scantily clad showgirl.
I came to realize, as a physician, that I was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution — not necessarily contradictory, just different.
I call it neo-evolution — the new evolution that is not simply natural, but guided and chosen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make.
Just a week ago, the National Academy of Engineering awarded its Draper Prize to Francis Arnold and Willem Stemmer, two scientists who independently developed techniques to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to desirable proteins in a more efficient way — what Frances Arnold calls "directed evolution." A couple of years ago, the Lasker Prize was awarded to the scientist Shinya Yamanaka for his research in which he took an adult skin cell, a fibroblast, and by manipulating just four genes, he induced that cell to revert to a pluripotential stem cell — a cell potentially capable of becoming any cell in your body.
And then, that same analytic technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease, will also enable us to adopt super-attributes, hyper-capacities — that better memory. Why not have the quick wit of a Ken Jennings, especially if you can augment it with the next generation of the Watson machine? Why not have the quick twitch muscle that will enable you to run faster and longer? Why not live longer?
Or, will we selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others of us? Will we make a society that is more boring and more uniform, or more robust and more versatile?
Now if you take this picture — I'm Italian originally, and every boy in Italy grows up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom — but the reason I'm showing you this is that something very interesting happened in Formula 1 racing over the past couple of decades.
And here was myself trying not to get wet, testing the sensors that open the water.
And that was, for us, was very interesting, because, as architects, as engineers, as designers, we always think about how people will use the things we design.
We've been working with Roberto Bolle, one of today's top ballet dancers — the étoile at Metropolitan in New York and La Scala in Milan — and actually captured his movement in 3D in order to use it as an input for Flyfire.
He was just a toddler and he wasn't very good at it, and he kept falling over.
But before I show you what I've got inside, I'm going to make a very public confession, and that is, I'm outfit-obsessed.
I've spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in.
He asked Octavio to be his chief of staff.
So I was asked by the president of Honduras who said that we need to do this project, this is important, this could be the way forward for our country.
The leader of the congress came up on stage and said, "Professor Romer, thank you very much for your lecture, but maybe we could watch the TEDTalk.
I'm a historian by training, and what I study in that case is the way that people have dealt with anatomy — meaning human bodies, animal bodies — how they dealt with bodily fluids, concepts of bodies; how have they thought about bodies.
The other hat that I've worn in my work is as an activist, as a patient advocate — or, as I sometimes say, as an impatient advocate — for people who are patients of doctors.
When the child is born, she looks like a girl. She is a girl, she is raised as a girl.
Most females like me — I believe myself to be a typical female — I don't actually know my chromosomal make-up, but I think I'm probably typical — most females like me are actually androgen-sensitive.
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from a man who was 19 years old, who was born a boy, raised a boy, had a girlfriend, had sex with his girlfriend, had a life as a guy, and had just found out that he had ovaries and a uterus inside.
Where I ran into the most heat from this most recently was last year when South African runner, Caster Semenya, had her sex called into question at the International Games in Berlin.
I'm a political progressive, I defend people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit to you that it makes me nervous.
And it's really clear, if you look at the history of the Founding Fathers, a lot of them were very interested in science, and they were interested in the concept of a naturalistic world.
I also want to point out that I'm not sure that is how we should distribute rights in terms of humans, because, I have to admit, that there are some golden retrievers I know that are probably more deserving of social services than some humans I know.
I'm glad to say we don't have the kind of situation with — a surgeon I talked to a few years ago who had brought over a set of conjoined twins in order to separate them, partly to make a name for himself.
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist, and that is that I think that there may be different kinds of insights that can come from different kinds of anatomies, particularly when we have people thinking in groups.
For years, because I've been interested in intersex, I've also been interested in sex-difference research.
And what we know from cross-cultural studies is that females, on average — not everyone, but on average — are more inclined to be very attentive to complex social relations and to taking care of people who are, basically, vulnerable within the group.
Years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my graduate advisors who knew I was interested in feminism — I considered myself a feminist, as I still do, asked a really strange question.
Years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my graduate advisors who knew I was interested in feminism — I considered myself a feminist, as I still do, asked a really strange question.
That is to say, there might be something, on average, different about female brains from male brains that makes us more attentive to deeply complex social relationships, and more attentive to taking care of the vulnerable.
I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, where I saw my first icebergs. I was in awe.
My heart beat fast, my head was dizzy, trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me
You know, what I do is write for children, and I'm probably America's most widely read children's author, in fact.
And I always tell people that I don't want to show up looking like a scientist.
You can have me as a farmer, or in leathers, and no one has ever chose farmer.
A friend of mine did that — Richard Bollingbroke.
My circle began back in the '60s in high school in Stow, Ohio where I was the class queer.
I was the guy beaten up bloody every week in the boys' room, until one teacher saved my life.
I had a thumb, I had 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California — met a lover — and back in the '80s, found it necessary to begin work on AIDS organizations.
About three or four years ago, I got a phone call in the middle of the night from that teacher, Mrs. Posten, who said, "I need to see you.
I'm disappointed that we never got to know each other as adults. Could you please come to Ohio, and please bring that man that I know you have found by now.
And just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me, she turned into a box of ashes and was placed in my hands.
And just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me, she turned into a box of ashes and was placed in my hands.
But I can tell you now, he was PC Simon Harwood, a police officer with London's Metropolitan Police Force.
Now, this does not show the attack on Ian Tomlinson, but he appears to be in some distress. Was he drunk? Did he fall over? Did this have anything to do with the police officers next to him?
The result was putting out stories ourselves.
But he was a political refugee from Angola.
He'd become unwell on the flight, the plane had returned to Heathrow, and then he was transferred to hospital and pronounced dead.
He had concerns about what happened on the flight.
(Audio) Michael: I'm pretty sure it'll turn out to be asphyxiation.
He's a professor at Cambridge University and a recipient of the Fields Medal, often called the Nobel Prize of mathematics.
And this seemed to break the ice, because a few minutes later, a high school teacher named Jason Dyer posted a suggestion.
I was not a serious participant, but I was following along closely from the start, and it was just amazing.
They were impressed by the implementation; they were impressed by the amount of initial seed material which had been put on the site; and most of all, they were excited by the vision.
And today, I'm very pleased to say, as a result, you can go online — anybody here — and download the human genome.
Just as a simple example, in 1987, we thought this guy was kind of crazy.
I'm author of two books on the subject of gamification, including the recent "Gamification by Design," published by O'Reilly.
So when I get invited to an event like this, I'm sure that all of you expect me to get up here and say, "Games are awesome for your children." Right?
Because I'm a games guy and this is how I make my living. (Applause)
And she trotted out experts like Dr Dimitri Christakis at the University of Washington, who said that kids who play a lot of video games may find the real world unpalatable or uninteresting, as a result of their sensitization to games.
So as an adult, he went back and got a master's in [Education] and took over a class at White Bear Lake Elementary School.
My ethics of seeing is informed by 25 years as a reporter covering emerging economies and international relations.
You not only get to cover science, but you get to meet interesting scientists, like my PhD advisor Revi Sterling, she, of the magic research high tops there.
Well, as a reporter, if I hang a microphone on someone, that is consent.
And when it comes to creating the story, I'll fact-check as a reporter, but I don't invite company to create that story, whereas social scientists, researchers, and particularly participatory researchers, will often work on constructing the narrative with the community.
In Guatemala, for 70 cents a day, you can help a child like Vilma get the clothes she needs to attend school.
My concern is: Are we one-noting the genders in our narratives of poverty in developing communities? Do we have women as victims, and are men only the perpetrators?
I will continue to work as a researcher and a reporter in developing countries, but I do it with an altered ethic of seeing.
One day, I was at a friend's office at work, and I noticed this book on the shelf, "Fluid Fuel Reactors." I was interested and asked him if I could borrow it.
And I asked last week, in a meeting with Dutch government representatives, I asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found plausible that people died because of the DigiNotar hack.
Now, when we think deeper about things like these, the obvious response from people should be, "OK, well, that sounds bad, but that doesn't really affect me, because I'm a legal citizen.
So when I ask you a question, since I'm blind, only raise your hand if you want to burn off some calories. (Laughter) Otherwise, when I ask you a question, and if your answer is yes, I'd like you to clap your hands.
So I one day decided to pay a visit to the manager, and I asked the manager, "Is this model of offering people all this choice really working?" And he pointed to the busloads of tourists that would show up everyday, with cameras ready usually.
He was the sonar engineer working for the Navy.
So he wrote a letter to the mathematician in the middle, a young mathematician in California at the time, Solomon Golomb.
Now, Galois is a very famous mathematician. He's famous because he invented a whole branch of mathematics which bears his name, called Galois field theory.
He's also famous because of the way that he died.
He was challenged to a duel, and he accepted.
And shortly before the duel occurred, he wrote down all of his mathematical ideas, sent letters to all of his friends, saying "Please, please" — this was 200 years ago — "Please, please, see that these things get published eventually." He then fought the duel, was shot and died at age 20.
Because of the mathematics that was developed 200 years ago, through another mathematician recently and an engineer, we were able to actually compose this, or construct this, using multiplication by the number three.
But I'm going to ask you a question. What do you think a batting average for a cardiac surgeon or a nurse practitioner or an orthopedic surgeon, an OBGYN, a paramedic is supposed to be?
I was an obsessive compulsive student.
I didn't pick up the phone and do what I was supposed to do, which was call my attending and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her for himself.
Don't do this. "In fact, so lacking in confidence was I that I actually asked the nurse who was looking after Mrs. Drucker," Do you think it's okay if she goes home? "And the nurse thought about it and said very matter-of-factly," Yeah, I think she'll do okay. "I can remember that like it was yesterday.
Don't do this. "In fact, so lacking in confidence was I that I actually asked the nurse who was looking after Mrs. Drucker," Do you think it's okay if she goes home? "And the nurse thought about it and said very matter-of-factly," Yeah, I think she'll do okay. "I can remember that like it was yesterday.
And it was there that another nurse, not the nurse who was looking after Mrs. Drucker before, but another nurse, said three words to me that are the three words that most emergency physicians I know dread.
The three words are: Do you remember? "Do you remember that patient you sent home?" the other nurse asked matter-of-factly. "Well she's back," in just that tone of voice.
And I was shocked and shaken to the core.
Over the next few weeks, I beat myself up and I experienced for the first time the unhealthy shame that exists in our culture of medicine — where I felt alone, isolated, not feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel, because you can't talk about it with your colleagues.
It's the one that says, not that what you did was bad, but that you are bad. And it was what I was feeling. And it wasn't because of my attending; he was a doll.
He talked to the family, and I'm quite sure that he smoothed things over and made sure that I didn't get sued.
And I made myself a bargain that if only I redouble my efforts to be perfect and never make another mistake again, please make the voices stop. And they did. And I went back to work. And then it happened again.
It was busy, I was in a bit of a hurry. He kept pointing here.
And two days later I came to do my next emergency shift, and that's when my chief asked to speak to me quietly in her office.
And she said the three words: Do you remember? "Do you remember that patient you saw with the sore throat?" Well it turns out, he didn't have a strep throat.
We have our cognitive biases, so that I can take a perfect history on a patient with chest pain.
I am a redefined physician. I'm human. I make mistakes. I'm sorry about that, but I strive to learn one thing that I can pass on to other people.
Now when I was a kid growing up, the future was kind of the year 2000, and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
I'm sitting here making grunting sounds basically, and hopefully constructing a similar messy, confused idea in your head that bears some analogy to it.
I went in and a strapping naval man stood up and addressed me.
The bell had rung, and I was seated at my desk, when one of my students, who is deaf, approached me and said that he ’ d like to join the military.
I already had a profession as a teacher, but I went ahead anyway and sent an email off to the program, explaining that I was a teacher of the deaf, wondering if I could take a few classes with them and perhaps share their lessons with my students.
That's the officer who emailed me back, saying I think you can have a few classes with us.
And it's collected by my general practitioner as well, so he can see what's my problem in weight, not on the very moment that I need cardiologic support or something like it, but also looking backward.
Back then, when Arjuna, the great Indian warrior prince, when he was thirsty, he'd take out a bow, he'd shoot it into the ground and water would come out.
I found myself becoming a little bit of a technophobe.
The child in me is really excited by these kinds of possibilities.
Another idea that really fascinated me as a child was that an entire galaxy could be contained within a single marble.
When I was a child, I had multiple collections of sticks and stones and pebbles and shells.
A child in London puts up a picture of a fox and says, "Oh, I saw a fox today." A child in India says, "I saw a monkey today." And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that you've actually taken.
How can I speak in 10 minutes about the bonds of women over three generations, about how the astonishing strength of those bonds took hold in the life of a four-year-old girl huddled with her young sister, her mother and her grandmother for five days and nights in a small boat in the China Sea more than 30 years ago.
Bonds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go — that small girl now living in San Francisco and speaking to you today.
He is a poet, a playwright, a man whose whole life had been balanced on the single hope of his country's unity and freedom.
My mother, Mai, was 18 when her father died — already in an arranged marriage, already with two small girls.
My mother was exhausted each night, but we told one another about our day and listened to the movements of my grandmother around the house.
And the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transition, angry and inflexible, and troubled children caught between two worlds.
In one, I was the classic Asian student, relentless in the demands that I made on myself.
In the other, I was enmeshed in lives that were precarious, tragically scarred by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
And for that work, when I was a final-year law student, I was chosen as the Young Australian of the Year.
And I was catapulted from one piece of the jigsaw to another, and their edges didn't fit.
Tan Le, anonymous Footscray resident, was now Tan Le, refugee and social activist, invited to speak in venues she had never heard of and into homes whose existence she could never have imagined.
I wanted to retreat to the routines and comfort of life in an unsung suburb — a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending each day as they had for almost 20 years, telling one another the story of their day and falling asleep, the three of us still in the same bed.
Her mother raised her alone.
Hi. I'm Kevin Allocca, I'm the trends manager at YouTube, and I professionally watch YouTube videos. It's true. So we're going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral and then why that even matters.
Because tastemakers like Jimmy Kimmel introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience.
When a friend of mine told me that I needed to see this great video about a guy protesting bicycle fines in New York City, I admit I wasn't very interested.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that becomes an information technology jumps on this curve, on Moore's Law, and experiences price performance doubling every 12 to 24 months.
And the conversation I had with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the great DIY innovators, I'd like to share with you — he gave me permission to do so — his technology called Slingshot that many of you may have heard of, it is the size of a small dorm room refrigerator.
And when these individuals went and looked at who was the best protein folder in the world, it wasn't an MIT professor, it wasn't a CalTech student, it was a person from England, from Manchester, a woman who, during the day, was an executive assistant at a rehab clinic and, at night, was the world's best protein folder.
And I think what we've learned is that, if you're a teacher your words can be meaningful, but if you're a compassionate teacher, they can be especially meaningful.
If you're a doctor you can do some good things, but if you're a caring doctor you can do some other things.
She was tough, she was strong, she was powerful.
And my grandmother was tough, but she was also loving.
When I would see her as a little boy, she'd come up to me and she'd give me these hugs.
My mom was the youngest of her 10 kids.
And I would look at her and I'd smile, but she was very serious.
Have some beer." Then he looked at me real hard and he said, "Oh, I hope you're not still hung up on that conversation Mama had with you." (Laughter) I said, "Well, what are you talking about?" He said, "Oh, Mama tells all the grandkids that they're special." (Laughter) I was devastated.
Have some beer." Then he looked at me real hard and he said, "Oh, I hope you're not still hung up on that conversation Mama had with you." (Laughter) I said, "Well, what are you talking about?" He said, "Oh, Mama tells all the grandkids that they're special." (Laughter) I was devastated.
Vaclav Havel, the great Czech leader, talked about this.
I had the great privilege, when I was a young lawyer, of meeting Rosa Parks.
And Ms. Parks used to come back to Montgomery every now and then, and she would get together with two of her dearest friends, these older women, Johnnie Carr who was the organizer of the Montgomery bus boycott — amazing African-American woman — and Virginia Durr, a white woman, whose husband, Clifford Durr, represented Dr. King.
I gave her my whole rap, and when I finished she looked at me and she said, "Mmm mmm mmm." She said, "That's going to make you tired, tired, tired." (Laughter) And that's when Ms. Carr leaned forward, she put her finger in my face, she said, "That's why you've got to be brave, brave, brave."
I think if somebody tells a lie, they're not just a liar.
I do get tired, as we all do.
And the judge has certified him as an adult, but I see this kid.
And I was up too late one night and I starting thinking, well gosh, if the judge can turn you into something that you're not, the judge must have magic power.
And I got into my car and I was feeling really overwhelmed — overwhelmed.
And as I was walking up the steps of this courthouse, there was an older black man who was the janitor in this courthouse.
And people started coming in because they were just outraged. I had written these crazy things.
And finally, this older black man with this very worried look on his face came into the courtroom and sat down behind me, almost at counsel table.
And this deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older black man. He said, "Jimmy, what are you doing in this courtroom?" And this older black man stood up and he looked at that deputy and he looked at me and he said, "I came into this courtroom to tell this young man, keep your eyes on the prize, hold on."
So he did what any good developer would do, he wrote an app.
There's a guy in the I.T. department of the City of Honolulu who saw this app and realized that he could use it, not for snow, but to get citizens to adopt tsunami sirens.
I'm influenced as much by the Apple on the right as the next person, but the Apple on the left — I mean, look at that logo!
And with these graphics, I was really interested in the aesthetic of the graphs.
Mark Hansen is a professor of statistics at UCLA.
This may sound strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
This was the first title I thought of for this talk, "Beethoven as Bill Gates." Does that make sense? Maybe not. OK, so think about that. Being an educator, I am going to tell you the story, and then you'll figure it out for yourselves.
But second of all, both of these guys are software designers.
Thanks very much. I am Hannah Fry, the badass. And today I'm asking the question: Is life really that complex?
The German physicist Werner Heisenberg said, "When I meet God, I'm going to ask him two questions: why relativity and why turbulence?
Sixty years later, Russian mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov furthered our mathematical understanding of turbulence when he proposed that energy in a turbulent fluid at length R varies in proportion to the 5 / 3rds power of R. Experimental measurements show Kolmogorov was remarkably close to the way turbulent flow works, although a complete description of turbulence remains one of the unsolved problems in physics.
At the end of the experiment, he was struggling to concentrate, had trouble with short-term memory, became paranoid, and started hallucinating.
Anne's a transgender female, and as her and I started talking, she was sharing with me about what brought her into treatment, but I could hear this fear in her voice, and I could see this worry in her eyes, and she began to tell me that she didn't fear coming into rehab and having to give up drugs and alcohol.
See, Leah was also assigned male at birth and she knew since she was a young child that she was not a male, that she was a female.
And when it stops swimming, that's depression. OK? And I'm from theoretical physics, so I'm used to people making very sophisticated mathematical models to precisely describe physical phenomena, so when I saw that this is the model for depression, I though to myself, "Oh my God, we have a lot of work to do."
In fact, I was recently talking to a buddy who had just left a job at a commercial grow operation because he was so concerned with the chemicals that he was being asked to interact with.
Even after all of my work on the front lines and as a former consumer myself, I was shocked and pissed when I started to see what commercialization was doing to cannabis, because, you see, our hope for something pure and natural is making it hard for us to see what's really going on, and that is that the rich are getting richer on the backs of the poor and lying to our faces the entire time.
For me to cast stones — listen, I'm a drug addict.
Those are my students, and whenever I'm asked to articulate my work or my priorities as a teacher, I explain that I believe education can be a tool for social justice.
So I'm all excited, I start driving to work, and the more I drive, the scareder I get.
Nobody will ever know I was thinking it if I don't say it. "But it wouldn't let me go, because God loves to show up as us, and because I look broken and I'm always called to stand in my wholeness, there was a call on my life to say this thing out loud.
I get to decide what the greatest vision of myself looks like.
OK, good, because I'm not alone and I have something to confess; I don't want you guys to judge me. This feels like a safe space, is it a safe space?
I was sitting in my car, looking in the rearview mirror, trying to figure out which friend I could call to call in a bomb threat, so I didn't have to go back in the building.
So, I had issues with this, because I haven't seen a lot of stay-at-home dads before and I thought men would judge me, so get this, I said this — please don't be offended — I said, "Uh, you know,
She smiled at me a smile only a woman full of knowledge can smile
And my newborn was in the bassinet, crying, tears running down his face.
I looked at myself in the mirror, and I said... "Which friend can you call to call in a bomb threat?
You know what else I thought as a stay-at-home parent?
I was talking to a friend of mine, he said, "Man, I come home from work, drawers are open, clothes hanging outside the drawers, the kids are still in their pajamas... And it can't be that hard to have dinner ready when I get home, right?"
She wakes up every morning, tired from the night before, baby attached to her breast, dropping this kid off at school, and taking this one to the park.
I have become an advocate for stay-at-home parents. Why? Because finally, I was standing in their shoes.
And Dr. Sylvia Earl has been influential, like John Muir, with administrations — George W. Bush and Obama were both fantastic ocean presidents, creating marine protected areas all around the country.
My friend Erik and I started building underwater robots, these little swimming cameras with lights that you can see underwater.
As a scientist, I have access to high-tech equipment that we can put over the side of the research vessel, and it measures oxygen and many more things.
I'm a scientist. I don't know if you could tell that. (Laughter) And I do solid science, I publish my results, my colleagues read them, I get citations of my work.
But I truly believe that, as a scientist, using mostly federal funds to do the research, I owe it to the public, to agency heads and congressional people to share my knowledge with them so they can use it, hopefully to make better decisions about our environmental policy.
I became a voracious comic book reader, but I never brought them to school.
My parents definitely were not fans, and I was certain that my teachers wouldn't be either.
Eventually I became a published cartoonist, writing and drawing comic books for a living.
I also became a high school teacher.
When I was a brand new teacher, I tried bringing comic books into my classroom.
But again, I was wrong.
A few years into my teaching career, I learned firsthand the educational potential of comics.
At the time, I was also the school's educational technologist, which meant every couple of weeks I had to miss one or two periods of this Algebra 2 class because I was in another classroom helping another teacher with a computer-related activity.
I was pretty certain that my students would love it, but I was wrong.
I had students coming up to me and saying things like, "Mr. Yang, we thought you were boring in person, but on video, you are just unbearable."
And I was so intrigued by this experience that I had with these comics lectures that I decided to focus my final master's project on comics.
He was wrong. Now, Dr. Wertham was actually a pretty decent guy.
Mr. Smith, one of my former colleagues, uses Scott McCloud's "Understanding Comics" in his literature and film class, because that book gives his students the language with which to discuss the relationship between words and images.
Another student gave us feedback that she had learned to design with empathy, as opposed to designing for functionality, which is what her engineering education had taught her.
You see, I'm a lawyer and I needed some evidence.
And I was figuring out how I was going to tell my mother, who had herself had breast cancer when she was pregnant with me.
That it would be my coworkers and my job that would make me feel valuable and human at times when I would have otherwise felt like a statistic.
But while I was ready for all the physical side effects, what really scared me was this thing called chemo brain.
And if this happened to me, I wondered how I was going to do my job as a lawyer. Would I be forced to leave work? And how could I possibly have a discussion with my manager about reasonable adjustments to my working arrangements when I didn't know how I was going to be impacted?
So for me, there were the tips and tricks that I learned about the treatment itself, like, before you go to chemo, you need to make sure you're really well hydrated and that you're warm, because it helps the nurses to find your veins.
And I thought about what could be done to guide these conversations, and then an amazing colleague of mine, Camilla Gunn, developed a "Working with Cancer" toolkit.
Our chief technology officer is an English major, and he was a bike messenger in Manhattan.
And fortunately, there's actually an easy answer, because the Arab lawyer and traveler Ibn Battuta traveled down the east coast of Africa in the 14th century, and what he found when he got to Mogadishu was a market, and he wrote about it.
Hi. My name's Sarah, and I've been priced out of the housing market.
And I'm sure we'd all be pretty sad to see that.
You be the judge. The professor in this famous scene, he's welcoming the new 1L class, and he says, "Look to your left.
To get my law degree, of course, it was really difficult, and [there were] frowns of disapproval.
And even when I was married, this tool became a tool for my own surveillance.
When I resisted this idea of being surveilled by my ex-husband, he really didn't approve of this and threw me out of his house, along with my six-month-old son, Abdullah.
I think of the women who do not have the necessary support to deal with the mental trauma when they feel unsafe in online spaces, and they go about their daily activities, thinking that there is a rape threat in their in-box.
I'd been attacked at public testimony at a Congressional hearing by a congressman with ties to the energy industry.
I'd been attacked at public testimony at a Congressional hearing by a congressman with ties to the energy industry.
One governor has publicly declared that he refuses to read the research.
That she can't forget how, growing up, she was called a dirty Jew with horns and tails.
But Lisa knows she can pass as white so she benefits from huge systemic and interpersonal privileges, and so she spends every day grappling with ways that she can leverage that white privilege for social justice.
When I was in eighth grade, my teacher gave me a vocabulary sheet with the word "genocide." I hated it. The word genocide is clinical... overgeneral... bloodless... dehumanizing.
I felt loved by my entire family and my neighbors.
My older sister Claire, she became a young mother... and a master at getting things done.
Making revelations of space is what I do; I'm a designer and creative director, and that's what I do for a living.
What he screwed up royally was that part where he said, "And we are merely players." It's ridiculous. We're not merely players.
Pee-Wee Herman is a child, and his entire world is created so that we perceive Pee-Wee as a child. The architecture and the furniture and everything come to life, but nothing more important than those stairs.
I mean, I'm sure I was thinking, "The drainage needs to be designed in this parking lot." But then I was like, "Everything in the world needs to be designed." And it's true: left to its own devices, Mother Nature isn't going to carve an interesting or necessarily helpful path for you.
And I suppose I could mention from one of the very earliest computer scientists, whose name was Norbert Wiener, and he wrote a book back in the '50s, from before I was even born, called "The Human Use of Human Beings." And in the book, he described the potential to create a computer system that would be gathering data from people and providing feedback to those people in real time in order to put them kind of partially, statistically, in a Skinner box, in a behaviorist system, and he has this amazing line where he says, one could imagine, as a thought experiment — and I'm paraphrasing, this isn't a quote — one could imagine a global computer system where everybody has devices on them all the time, and the devices are giving them feedback based on what they did, and the whole population is subject to a degree of behavior modification.
I'm certain it's possible.
And I'm certain that the companies, the Googles and the Facebooks, would actually do better in this world.
Now, this little boy here, Pamelo, from Zambia, he has trachoma.
A colleague and I were traveling in a very remote village, and we asked an old man to take us down into a little tomb.
In fact, President Carter, he talks about how trachoma was a real problem in Georgia when he was a little boy.
But before I finish, I just want to share with you some words from the founder of Sightsavers, a guy called Sir John Wilson.
Now, he was blinded at the age of 12.
And a couple of months before I met her, she'd had the operation.
As a college student, I went on an expedition across the Atlantic with a team of scientists using a high-powered laser to measure microscopic algae.
I am convinced that the discoveries awaiting us in the twilight zone will be just as breathtaking.
So I'm a scientist who studies life in the ocean.
At Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, I'm really fortunate to be surrounded by colleagues who share this passion.
First, let me introduce myself, I'm Fred, I've been an environmentalist since I was a kid, when I watched the fish and the frogs in my neighborhood pond die from a chemical spill. That bothered me. Later, a professor inspired me to think about environmentalism differently.
Dr. King called her the "the architect of the civil rights movement," because she created something called Citizenship Schools.
So I have a friend. She's an actress, she's in her 60s. She's super bright, badass, emotionally intelligent.
It was really crowded, as it is around the holidays, and she was filling out some forms and she was really focused. And out of nowhere, someone moved her out of the way — just physically put their hands on her and moved her out of the way.
Maybe he had said something to her, maybe he didn't, she didn't hear it... Either way, she was focused, she was filling out the form. And the next thing you know, there were hands on her, and she was being moved out of the way.
She said that she was shocked at first — yeah.
And she went on to say, "I mean, I wanted to get physical. I don't know — I was furious.
That's lifetimes of women dealing with men who assume they know better for us than we know for ourselves, being the property of husbands, landowners, and having old, white men tell us the fate of our lady parts; lifetimes of having our bodies used for love and objects of desire, instead of bodies that we get to wield and use as we choose.
When women get manhandled, we start to rationalize, try to figure out the ways that it was — "It was probably our fault. You know what? He probably said something, and I didn't hear him.
Women have been trained to think that we are overreacting or that we're being too sensitive or unreasonable. We try to make sense of nonsense, and we swallow the furious feelings.
So my fellow women and our gentle men, as we are here together within this particular window of this large-scale movement towards women's equality, and as we envision a future that does not yet exist, we both have different invitations.
It was the first time we flew it, and the star of the show, of course, brother and sister side boosters landing. I was excited.
I mean, how did you end up an engineer and President of SpaceX? Were you supernerdy as a girl?
But I actually got into engineering not because of that book but because my mom took me to a Society of Women Engineers event, and I fell in love with the mechanical engineer that spoke.
And I used to shy away from telling that story, but if that's what caused me to be an engineer — hey, I think we should talk about that.
CA: Sixteen years ago, you became employee number seven at SpaceX, and then over the next years, you somehow built a multi-billion-dollar relationship with NASA, despite the fact that SpaceX's first three launches blew up.
I'm a good sleeper, that's my best thing.
CA: Gwynne, you became President of SpaceX 10 years ago, I think. What's it been like to work so closely with Elon Musk?
But then once I realized that that's his job, and my job is to get the company close to comfortable so he can push again and put us back on that slope, then I started liking my job a lot more, instead of always being frustrated.
I'm sure Elon will want us to go faster. (Laughter) CA: That's certainly amazing. (Laughter) GS: I'm personally invested in this one, because I travel a lot and I do not love to travel, and I would love to get to see my customers in Riyadh, leave in the morning and be back in time to make dinner.
I am a wild woman, a rebel singer, a conduit.
So as a victims' rights attorney fighting to increase the prospect of justice for survivors across the country and as a survivor myself, I'm not here to say, "Time's Up." I'm here to say, "It's time." It's time for accountability to become the norm after gender violence.
So, "beta," for those of you unfamiliar, is shorthand online lingo for "beta male." But let's be real, I wear pearl earrings and my fashion aesthetic is rich-white-woman-running-errands, so I'm not angling to be an alpha.
But my favorite, favorite, favorite is "cuck." It's a slur, short for "cuckold," for men who have been cheated on by their wives.
He had written to tell me that I was a moron, I was a reason this country was dividing itself, and he added at the end that being gay was a sin.
Because some of the hate I received was from "my side." So when Matthew, a queer liberal artist like me publicly wrote that I represented some of the worst aspects of liberalism, I wanted to ask him this.
At the end of these conversations, there's often a moment of reflection. A reconsideration. And that's exactly what happened at the end of my call with a guy named Doug who had written that I was a talentless propaganda hack.
DM: At the end of these conversations, there's often a moment of reflection. A reconsideration. And that's exactly what happened at the end of my call with a guy named Doug who had written that I was a talentless propaganda hack.
I also want to be super clear about something.
You are a cheerleader for vulgar American can-doism, with the rah-rah spirit of boardroom ideology, Silicon Valley and the Chamber of Commerce.
It happened when feudal Europe was brought under the control of centralized kingdoms, so that today a Western European has 1 / 35th the chance of being murdered compared to his medieval ancestors.
This is an acute question for me, because I'm a prominent advocate of the existence of human nature, with all its shortcomings and perversities.
Since 1992, Dr. Max Bothwell, a Government of Canada scientist, has been studying a type of algae that grows on rocks.
The problem was, Dr. Bothwell wasn't allowed to speak to the reporter, because the government of the day wouldn't let him.
I saw it firsthand when I was a university professor.
She pulls back the covers and makes the gruesome discovery. Vera was dead. When it comes to Spanish flu, those stories are common, of lightning speed deaths.
Well, I was a professor in my mid-20s when I first heard those shocking facts and the scientist in me wanted to know why and how.
After all, I was a scientist, I came from the world under attack, and I had personally felt the outrage.
One government scientist, a friend of mine, we'll call him McPherson, was concerned about the impact government policies were having on his research and the state of science deteriorating in Canada.
He was so concerned, he wrote to me from his wife's email account because he was afraid a phone call could be traced.
I listened and I shared what I learned with my friend in Parliament, a man who was interested in all things environment, science, technology, innovation.
I'm a first-generation American.
He came for school, earning his bachelor's degree in accounting and eventually became an accountant.
I mean, I thought I was black.
But he would say, "But you're African. Remember that." And he would emphasize this, even though many Africans in the continent would only consider me to be just an American.
It's Asian women who are least likely to be promoted.
Capturing these stories and issues is part of my work as a digital storyteller that uses tech to make it easier for people to find these stories.
When I was hired by the Free Library in 2013, I specifically chose to work at McPherson because I understand what it's like to grow up in an environment where substance use disorder shapes the everyday, and I wanted to use those personal experiences as a guide for my work.
But before the ambulance arrived, she and her friend ran off.
He was loved and respected, and everyone was taking care of him, and this is not always how it goes, because some males don't end so well when they lose their position.
The other male is pant-grunting to him, is being submissive to him and bowing for him, and that is the sort of ritual they need to go through many times a day in order to have a stable relationship.
The male whom he is grooming on the side is twice as old, and this old male has made him the leader.
So in humans, of course, I am always intrigued by these men who are candidates and hold babies up like this.
If you don't do that, that old male is going to get mad at you, and you're going to lose him as a partner.
I'm a Harvard Business School professor, but I was super attracted to going to an organization that was metaphorically and perhaps quite literally on fire.
Now I am liberated from that commitment, as I am back at HBS, and what I'd like to do is share with you how far I have taken that liberty, which, it's baby steps,
I have been tempted at every step of my career, tempted personally and tempted by coaching of others, to mute who I am in the world.
I'm not an engineer. I did not study engineering in school. But I was a super ambitious student growing up.
In middle school and high school, I had straight A's, and I graduated at the top of my year.
Every summer when I was growing up, I would fly from my home in Canada to visit my grandparents, who lived in Mumbai, India.
So, while I'm very excited about all we can do for cooling, and I think there's a lot yet to be done, as a scientist, I'm also drawn to a more profound opportunity that I believe this work highlights.
Since this product would be readily interacting with the body, it had to be biocompatible, it also had to be low-cost, as I was designing it and paying for it myself.
Things grow, and they grow up and they mature, and it's only by doing so that they can thrive for a very long time. We already know this. If I told you my friend went to the doctor who told her she had a growth that feels very different, because we intuitively understand that when something tries to grow forever within a healthy, living, thriving system, it's a threat to the health of the whole.
I watched in horror heartbreaking footage of the head nurse, Malak, in the aftermath of the bombing, grabbing premature babies out of their incubators, desperate to get them to safety, before she broke down in tears.
So when IDA asked for help, I decided to launch CanDo seven months early, with very little money, and many people, including myself, thought I had finally gone mad.
I have this — not a scientist myself — but an uncanny ability to understand everything about science, except the actual science — (Laughter)
So here's how it looks from a banana-peel-universe point of view, from my mindset, which I call "Emily's universe." First of all, I am incredibly grateful for life, but I don't want to be immortal.
A headline from the Los Angeles Times: "Anne Frank: Not so nice after all." (Laughter) Plus, I love being in sync with the cyclical rhythms of the universe.
I don't have to use the executive brain function... Ha, ha, ha, I win! (Laughter) And I am so grateful to you. I don't want to say "the audience," because I don't really see it as we're two separate things.
So it's my turn and I'm standing next to my table, everything neatly lined up, and I'm just hoping that my professors can see how much effort I've put into making my designs practical and ergonomic and sustainable.
And I'm starting to get really nervous, because for a long time, no one says anything.
But I was also kind of intrigued, because joy is this intangible feeling, and how does that come from the stuff on the table next to me?
The architect Emmanuelle Moureaux uses this idea in her work a lot.
My specialty, as a sex educator, is I bring the science.
At the end of a conference in a hotel lobby once, I'm literally on my way out the door and a colleague chases me down. "Emily, I just have a really quick question.
A friend of mine — (Laughter) wants to know if it's possible to get addicted to her vibrator. "The answer is no, but it is possible to get spoiled.
He was like, "So, that could explain this one time, when I was in high school, I... I got an erection in response to the phrase 'doughnut hole.'" (Laughter) Did he want to have sex with the doughnut? No. He was a teenage boy flooded with testosterone, which makes everything a little bit sex-related.
I got a phone call from a 30-something friend, a woman, she said, "So, my partner and I were in the middle of doing some things and I was like, 'I want you right now.' And he said, 'No, you're still dry, you're just being nice.' And I was so ready.
I got a phone call from a 30-something friend, a woman, she said, "So, my partner and I were in the middle of doing some things and I was like, 'I want you right now.' And he said, 'No, you're still dry, you're just being nice.' And I was so ready.
Another friend, back in college, told me about her first experiences of power play in a sexual relationship.
She told me that her partner tied her up with her arms over her head like this, she's standing up and he positions her so she's straddling a bar, presses up against her clitoris, like this.
It's a power play. Leaves her alone. So there's my friend, and she goes, "I'm bored."
And the guy comes back and she says, "I am bored." And he looks at her and he looks at the bar and he says, "Then why are you wet?" Why was she wet?
But the perpetrator ’ s lawyer made sure the jury knew about those orgasms because he thought the orgasms could be construed as consent.
Thank you so much. I know that you do this all the time, and yet, still, I'm so grateful to you for having the courage to come and talk about that on this stage.
It really took a lot and we're very grateful to you. So thank you. Emily Nagoski: I am grateful to be here.
I'd gone to see Pete, who was renowned for his workmanship with steel.
Pete, like myself, was a tradie, or a tradesman.
We do like to shorten things in the Australian vernacular. A tradie. There was an expectation as a tradie.
That was the epiphany. That was the moment where I was standing in a community hall in a place where this Castlemaine community had given me such support for 20 years, this community had backed my work, I'd played footy there, I'd done theater there, I was so grateful for what they'd given me.
Yet because of my tradie culture and that ignorant attitude that we have in the tradie community, I didn't feel confident at all.
Tradies especially, and I'm a tradie myself, we love egg and bacon rolls.
I myself was one of them, and this is what I talk about at the HALT events, that four years ago when I founded HALT, I didn't know I could go to the doctor about my mental health and get a mental health plan.
And invariably at every single HALT event at a hardware store, I have one tradie come up to me, at least one come up and tell me about his suicide attempt.
For example, I can be a good patriot, loyal to my country, and at the same time, be loyal to my family, my neighborhood, my profession, humankind as a whole, truth and beauty.
Another technological danger that threatens the future of democracy is the merger of information technology with biotechnology, which might result in the creation of algorithms that know me better than I know myself.
A dictator may not be able to provide me with good health care, but he will be able to make me love him and to make me hate the opposition.
As for the rest of us who are not engineers, the number one question facing us is how not to allow ourselves to be manipulated by those who control the data.
But you can never know, because, as a historian, I know that you should never underestimate human stupidity. (Laughter) (Applause) It is one of the most powerful forces that shape history.
Your grandmother's dying wish was to be buried back home in Korea. "
I was born in Korea — the land of kimchi; raised in Argentina, where I ate so much steak that I'm probably 80 percent cow by now; and I was educated in the US
During my childhood, I felt very much Argentinian, but my looks betrayed me at times.
I remember on the first day of middle school, my Spanish literature teacher came into the room. She scanned all of my classmates
And so it turns out that I was too Korean to be Argentinian, but too Argentinian to be Korean.
So with this realization in mind, I decided to embrace all of the different versions of myself — even allow myself to reinvent myself at times.
So for example, in high school, I have to confess I was a mega-nerd.
Then I became an investor, a woman in tech, a teacher.
It's more about allowing myself to embrace all of the possible permutations of myself and cultivating diversity within me and not just around me.
Now, as for my grandmother, her last wish was also her last lesson to me. It turns out that it was never about going back to Korea and being buried there.
And then, as you said, in 2011, Ted Sarandos, my partner at Netflix who runs content, got very excited about "House of Cards." And at that time, it was 100 million dollars, it was a fantastic investment, and it was in competition with HBO.
Not me! I'm the child of a missionary, I don't even think about these things. But —
RH: Sure. Right out of college, I was a high school math teacher.
One was a British schoolgirl, who had been taken off of a plane at London Heathrow as she was trying to make her way to Syria to join ISIS. And she was 13 years old. So I sat down with her and her father, and I said, "Why?" And she said, "I was looking at pictures of what life is like in Syria, and I thought I was going to go and live in the Islamic Disney World."
And I'm sitting there in this makeshift prison in the north of Iraq with this 23-year-old who had actually trained as a suicide bomber before defecting.
I'm an MIT professor, but I do not design buildings or computer systems.
Jim Ewing: The morning after the first time I was attached to the robot, my daughter came downstairs and asked me how it felt to be a cyborg, and my answer was that I didn't feel like a cyborg.
Before my legs were amputated, I was a terrible student.
Then, after my limbs were amputated, I suddenly became an MIT professor.
Jim Ewing fell to earth and was badly broken, but his eyes turned skyward, where he always longed to return.
Using this technology, Jim returned to the Cayman Islands, the site of his accident, rebuilt as a cyborg to climb skyward once again.
And in that same decade, somebody — legend has it, somebody named Thespis — invented the idea of dialogue.
And storytelling is much like what's happening right now: I'm standing up here, the unitary authority, and I am talking to you. And you are sitting back, and you are receiving what I have to say.
And you may disagree with it, you may think I'm an insufferable fool, you may be bored to death, but that dialogue is mostly taking place inside your own head.
Everything changes, because at that moment, I'm not the possessor of truth; I'm a guy with an opinion.
He didn't mean it complimentarily, but Joe put it up in the lobby, he was so proud of it.
And I'm incredibly proud of that.
And under the guidance of the amazing Lear deBessonet, we started the Public Works program, which now every summer produces these immense Shakespearean musical pageants, where Tony Award-winning actors and musicians are side by side with nannies and domestic workers and military veterans and recently incarcerated prisoners, amateurs and professionals, performing together on the same stage.

And studies have found that if she's pregnant, she doesn't even bother.
But for now, the next time you hear a mosquito buzzing, just pause and remember she may be in love and she may be singing her song, looking for her perfect match.
My friend Ilya has been observing the classic fighting behavior between California two-spot octopuses.
So I decided to quit my job as a university professor to dedicate my life to save more ocean places like this.
She was my partner in raising three wonderful, now grown children, and really, she was my girl, you know?
Amy was a prolific author.
She was also a terrific public speaker, talking with children and adults of all ages all over the world.
Each told beautiful stories of Amy and of us.
In the early months following Amy's death, though, I was sure that the feeling of despair would be ever-present, that it would be all-consuming.
One friend in particular who had also lost her life partner kept repeating, "Jason, you will find joy." I didn't even know what she was talking about.
There it was, dancing the night away at an LCD Soundsystem concert, traveling with my brother and best friend or with a college buddy on a boys' trip to meet a group of great guys I never met before.
Let's go back to 1975. Yep, this is me.
I've got a lot to learn, I'm a computer engineer, I've got long hair, but I'm working under Andy Grove, who's been called the greatest manager of his or any other era.
Let's go back to 1975. Yep, this is me. I've got a lot to learn, I'm a computer engineer, I've got long hair, but I'm working under Andy Grove, who's been called the greatest manager of his or any other era.
Andy was a superb leader and also a teacher, and he said to me, "John, it almost doesn't matter what you know.
So here's a classic video from the 1970s of professor Andy Grove.
Now, I've been called the Johnny Appleseed of OKRs for spreading the good gospel according to Andy Grove, but I want you to join me in this movement.
As a biologist, I'm still trying to learn, with others, how everyone's related to each other, who is related to whom.
Here is a little cute guy developed at Harvard University, and he walks thanks to waves of pressure applied along its body, and thanks to the flexibility, he can also sneak under a low bridge, keep walking, and then keep walking a little bit different afterwards.
But I'm a biomedical engineer, and perhaps the application I like the most is in the medical field, and it's very difficult to imagine a closer interaction with the human body than actually going inside the body, for example, to perform a minimally invasive procedure.
For the last two and a half years, I'm one of the few, if not the only, child psychiatrist operating in refugee camps, shorelines and rescue boats in Greece and the Mediterranean Sea.
I want to tell you about Omar, a five-year-old Syrian refugee boy who arrived to the shore on Lesbos on a crowded rubber boat.
Crying, frightened, unable to understand what's happening to him, he was right on the verge of developing a new trauma.
I'm James. I'm a writer and artist, and I make work about technology.
I make things like neural networks that predict the results of elections based on weather reports, because I'm intrigued about what the actual possibilities of these weird new technologies are.
A friend of mine, Eleanor Saitta, always says that any technological problems of sufficient scale and scope are political problems first of all.
While working on this in our office, we've realized that we're building upon the work of our colleagues, including architect Tatiana Bilbao, working in Mexico City; Pritzker laureate Alejandro Aravena, working in Chile; and recent Pritzker winner Balkrishna Doshi, working in India.
I'm convinced that we can build cities of difference that help to create the global mosaic to which so many of us aspire.
French engineer Michel Virlogeux and British architect Lord Foster collaborated together to produce something which is a really spectacular synergy of architecture and engineering.
And yet of course they want innovation. Innovation is vital. As an engineer, it's part of my DNA.
I couldn't be a very good engineer if I wasn't wanting to innovate, but we have to do so from a position of knowledge and strength and understanding.
But there was this doctor named Bruno Lunenfeld, who wondered if he could actually isolate those hormones from the urine and use it to help women who are having trouble getting pregnant.
Well, I'm a science journalist and multimedia producer, who has always been fascinated by gross stuff.
To explain what I mean, why don't I tell you a little bit about what I was like as a child?
So, I was what you might call a gross kid. In fact, my love of science itself began when my parents bought me a slime chemistry set and was then only enhanced by doing gross experiments in my sixth-grade biology class.
Now, the fact that I was obsessed with gross stuff as a kid is not so revolutionary. You know, lots of kids are really into gross things, like playing in dirt or collecting beetles or eating their boogers. And why is that?
And, of course, I always tell them that I am not a medical professional, and that, if possible, they should talk to a doctor.
My doctor turned serious and he looked at me and said, "Travis, that's a lot of opioids.
When she pushed him and said, "You know, he's really quite badly off," the doctor responded, "Well, if it's that bad, he can just go back to his previous dose for a little while."
Sadiye got back on the phone with the prescriber and this time he recommended that we contact our pain management team from the last hospitalization.
Furious, we called the prescriber back and begged him for anything — anything that could help me — but instead he apologized, saying that he was out of his depth. "Look," he told us, "my initial advice to you is clearly bad, so my official recommendation is that Travis go back on the medication until he can find someone more competent to wean him off."
Because if the symptoms didn't kill me outright, I'd kill myself.
But I believed it to my core because I no longer had any hope that I would be normal again.
When my desperation was clearly coming through my voice, much as it is now, the receptionist took a deep breath and said, "Mr. Rieder, it sounds like perhaps what you need is a rehab facility or a methadone clinic." I didn't know any better at the time, so I took her advice.
The prescribers saw me as a complex patient needing specialized care, probably from pain medicine.
He did not want to be a farmer.
Growing up, he saw his parents work so hard as farmers, but barely get by.
Angry, these young men set out to wreak vengeance on a society that they believed had turned its back on them.
My friends, in the next 20 years, over 400 million Saminus are entering the African workforce, with potentially half of them having opportunities in agriculture.
Imagine a world where millions of young men across Africa, hardworking young men, have other options.
I know these driven, ambitious young men will make the right choice.
In 2001, at the age of 22, I took a job as head of housekeeping at Vundumtiki Camp in the Okavango Delta... a patchwork mosaic of channels, floodplains, lagoons and thousands upon thousands of islands to explore.
This is a mass drowning of 15,000 wildebeests that I witnessed in the Maasai Mara two years ago.
China's largest taxi-hailing platform, called Didi Chuxing, launched a new service called Hitch, which matches car owners who are driving home with passengers looking for long-distance routes.
I am a product of the American tech industry, both as a consumer and a corporate leader.
So I am well acquainted with this type of fuel.
Luo Zhaoliu is a 34-year-old engineer from Jiangxi province.
And so a young scientist that I was working with at the time, Rob Olson, was able to take this thing apart, put it on a ship, put it back together and take it off to sea.
I'm a forensic developmental psychologist, and I study these types of cases.
As a researcher, a professor and a new parent, my goal is to conduct scientific research that helps us understand how kids function in a legal system that was designed for adults.
In March of 2006, police interrogated Brendan Dassey, a 16-year-old high school student with an IQ around 70, putting him in the range of intellectual disability.
Lindsay Malloy: They told Brendan that honesty would "set him free," but they were completely convinced of his guilt at that point.
People were very angry about how Brendan was questioned, and many assumed that his interrogation had to have been illegal. It wasn't illegal. As someone who's a researcher in this area and is familiar with police interrogation training manuals, I wasn't really surprised by what I saw.
As a parent and as a researcher, I think we can do better.
I am a biologist and an engineer who builds stuff out of DNA.
I mean, come on, as a scientist looking for a job, doing cutting-edge research, it doesn't get any better than this.
Like an author of a book, this started out as writing short sentences, or sequences of DNA code, but this soon turned into writing paragraphs and then full-on novels of DNA code, to make important biological instructions for proteins and living cells.
When I was a kid, I was, like many of you in this room, very much fascinated by Star Wars, and what fascinated me the most is this notion of the Force, this energy that connects all people and all objects and allows you to feel people that you can't even see.
And I remember many nights, I would be sitting at home, just, like, concentrating and focusing, trying to feel the Force, and I didn't feel anything, don't worry. (Laughter) And later in life, I became a scientist.
I'm sure many of you have seen this picture.
So I'm really excited because we have deployed the device with many patients.
So when I started, I told you that I'm really fascinated with Star Wars and the Force in Star Wars, and indeed, I'm still very much fascinated, even now, as a grown-up, with Star Wars, waiting for the next movie.
But I'm very fascinated now and excited about this new Force of wireless signals, and the potential of changing health care with this new force.
She has heart failure, and I'm sure many of you guys in the audience have parents, grandparents, loved ones who have chronic diseases.
I am tired of trying to fake appearances.
A friend told me that I'm broke not poor, and there is a difference.
I wrote it because I was tired of pretending I was all right when I wasn't.
I was tired of faking normal.
Even as I was coming out, I was still hiding.
Last year, a good friend of mine asked me if I would help her with some organization work.
A few things you should know about me: I'm an action-oriented overachieving math and theater nerd, who ended up with an MBA.
But two minutes in, I could tell it wasn't going to be a thing and I was relieved not to be spending dinner with him.
After that, I was a little nervous about going to my next zero date.
By the way, here's Richard Feynman, who in addition to being a Nobel Prize winner in physics was also known as a legendary teacher. Wouldn't it be great if we could bring him back to give his lectures and inspire millions of kids, perhaps not just in English but in any language?
As a researcher, I'm also working on countermeasure technology, and I'm part of an ongoing effort at AI Foundation, which uses a combination of machine learning and human moderators to detect fake images and videos, fighting against my own work.
But I'm excited and hopeful, because if we use it right and carefully, this tool can allow any individual's positive impact on the world to be massively scaled and really help shape our future the way we want it to be.
I can have more fun. But of course, I know that eventually things become so obscure that I start losing some of you. So as a designer, it's absolutely key to have a good understanding of the visual and cultural vocabulary of your audience.
I've tried to become a better artist by becoming a better observer of images.
Even as a kid, I got angry it was ignoring the laws of physics.
They wanted her piecemealed, papier-mâchéd, practically broken, limp-like and loveless, a litany of exaggeration. They wanted her low. And high. Flat and wide. Filled with all of their empty.
Oh, they wanted her bland. And barren. Unspirited, un-African, uncultured, under siege in the streets.
They wanted her face down, ass up, hands cuffed and ankles strapped.
Oh, they wanted her holy, baptized in her divine, they wanted her secrets, pearls to swine.
They wanted her whole, though they came fractioned, half-hearted, half-soul, with no regards and no knowledge as to who she really was.
They wanted her whole, though they came fractioned, half-hearted, half-soul, with no regards and no knowledge as to who she really was.
For wild women are not to be tamed. Only admired. Just let her in and witness her set your days ablaze.
You know, as an architect, at 10 o ’ clock in the morning, you need to be a poet, for sure.
Together with my friend in adventure, Richard Rogers, we were, at the time, young bad boys.
(Laughter) I'm Italian, and I love beauty. I love beauty. Well, let's go sailing, I want to take you sailing here, to this place, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.
In 2001, I was a brand new, shiny doctor, planning to save the world.
As an educator, designer, I'd like to share with you five simple concepts that I've developed through my work.
Twenty-five years ago, when I was a young pup, very optimistic, we wanted to design a park in downtown Oakland, California for the homeless people.
I knew that if in one hour, our child didn't come, I was going to leave her there and go back to work and make a presentation about AI to my boss, Apple's CEO.
And I was a prime and willing victim to that type of workaholic thinking. I worked incredibly hard. That's why I almost left my wife in the delivery room, that's why I worked 996 alongside my entrepreneurs. And that obsession that I had with work ended abruptly a few years ago when I was diagnosed with fourth stage lymphoma.
Katie has been raped and her lifeless body has been found in the woods three days later, after her disappearance.
The police is targeting three suspects, having narrowed down the search from over 20 men who had been seen in that area on the same day.
We passed this information to the police, and they found out that, actually, Thomson is a drug addict, and he also has a medical record for psychotic episodes, for which presumably the antidepressant was prescribed.
So now Thomson becomes the more likely suspect.
And I'm really, really thrilled that after nine years of intense research, as of 2017, we are able to contribute to police investigations.
Ordinary women who did extraordinary things with the greatest of their courage, wisdom and humility.These are my teachers.
On the same line, I ended up in a very small village, fell in love with a young, handsome, dynamic young farmer-leader who was not very educated, but he could pull the crowd.
on the grounds — Reserve Bank said that we cannot issue a license to the bank whose promoting members who are nonliterate. I was terrified. I was crying. And by coming back home, I was continuously crying.
And today, Kerabai is doing a regular radio program, and not only that, she's become a famous radio jockey and she has been invited by all of the radios, even from Mumbai.
She has taken a course in a business school, and she has become a veterinary doctor.
She did successful goat deliveries in the region and she became a famous goat doctor.
When I went to her house, I was even more amazed because upper caste leaders — men — were sitting in the house, in her house, and having chai and water, which is very rare in India.
I am just — I couldn't be more proud of her.
I am so lucky that I'm working with these women.
They are sharing their stories with me, they are sharing their wisdom with me, and I'm just lucky to be with them.
20 years before — and I'm so proud — we went to Reserve Bank of India and we set up the first rural women's bank.
Growing up, I was an avid athlete.
In a matter of seconds, I went from playing at the top to the bottom of my ability. Just knowing that I was being evaluated changed my performance and forever how I thought about the mental aspect of how we perform.
All of a sudden the ball seemed to go in slow motion, and I was fixated on my every move.
It wasn't so long ago that you could purchase a Teen Talk Barbie that when the cord was pulled, it would say things like, "Will we ever have enough clothes?" and "Math class is tough." And just a few years ago, major retailers were marketing T-shirts at our young girls that read things like, "I'm too pretty to do math," or, "I'm too pretty to do my homework so my brother does it for me."
Even though I studied for my first midterm exam — I thought I was ready to go — I bombed it.
I was convinced I wasn't going to be a science major, that maybe I was dropping out of college altogether.
But when I walked into the final, my mind was quiet, and I actually got one of the highest grades in the entire class.
So what I did was, I began to develop that acrostic poem into a full training entitled "I'm G.R.A.C.E.D." Because I remember, being the front-desk specialist, and when I went to the office of equity to start working, I was like, "Is that why they asked us to ask that question?" It all became a bright light to me, and I realized that I asked people and I told people about — I called them by the wrong gender, I called them by the wrong race, I called them by the wrong ethnicity, and the environment became hostile, people was offended and I was frustrated because I was not graced.
Robert became fearful and withdrawn.
A scientist in my lab developed a new way to analyze DNA with computers, and he discovered something very surprising.
I was always fascinated by things that moved, catching small animals, holding them in my hands, feeling the magic of their movement; playing with fire, thrilled and terrified at its unrelenting force, accidentally burning my father's barn down — just once.
When I was 27 years old, I found myself in a rat-infested New York City loft, getting ready to hurl myself off a ladder.
We reached as far up as heaven that day, I'm pretty sure of it.
And I'll be honest: I was a young, naive, Sri Lankan girl,
Looking back, I am extremely grateful for the positive response that I received, not only from academia, but also patients, and people around the world affected by this terrible disease.
And I am confident that with the right collaborations, we will beat this terrible disease.
I have to tell you, I was a little bit hurt. (Laughter) I mean, he wanted to do a book with my students and not with me, but OK, it's all right.
A young man named Brian sent me a beautiful note saying, "I know I've been rejected from this program twice, but I want to thank you for the opportunity.
I choose to be called Mary. As a teacher, I've stood in front of 120 students, so this stage does not intimidate me.
And my father, who had been absent in most of my early childhood, was doing what other men were doing: fighting for the country.
My father, on the other hand, was rich. He had many cows.
I remember my mother was pregnant, when she would take turns to carry me and my younger sister.
There, I found my father's first wife, my half sisters and my half brothers.
Education shall be your first husband. "And with these words came in his first big investment. I felt lucky!
I was alone, in school, when I heard of her death.
They said her family did not find it fit for her children, who are all girls, to attend her burial, simply because we were girls.
But then, in 2012, life took away the only thing that I was clinging on. My father died. My grades in school started to collapse, and when I sat for my final high school exams in 2015, I was devastated to receive a C grade.
OK, I keep telling students in my class, "It's not about the A's; it's about doing your best." That was not my best. I was determined. I wanted to go back and try again.
But then, one of my best friends, a beautiful Kenyan lady, Esther Kaecha, called me during this devastating moment, and she was like, "Mary, you have a strong will.
Sometimes they will jokingly say, "You are going to lose your market value the more educated you become." But the truth is, an educated woman is feared in my community.
And that is who we are, my sisters and I. And I'm so proud of that.
And that is who we are, my sisters and I. And I'm so proud of that.
As a teacher, I see my classroom as a laboratory that not only generates skills and knowledge but also understanding and hope.
I began by saying that I am a teacher.
I made friends with the kids at the camp and even started embracing some of their cultures, celebrating holidays like Christmas even though I was raised Muslim.
My name is Halima Aden and I'm a black, Muslim, Somali-American from Kenya.
Some have called me a trailblazer — I was the first Muslim homecoming queen at my high school, the first Somali student senator at my college and the first hijab-wearing woman in many places, like the Miss Minnesota USA beauty pageant, the runways of Milan and New York Fashion Weeks and even on the historic cover of British "Vogue." As you can see, I'm not afraid to be the first, to step out on my own, to take risks and seek change, because that's what being a minority is about.
Being a child refugee has taught me that one could be stripped of everything: food, shelter, clean drinking water, even friendship, but the one thing that no one could ever take away from you is your education.
When I first started wearing it, I was excited.
But when I started middle school, the students teased me about not having hair, so to prove them wrong, I started showing them my hair — something that goes against my beliefs, but something I felt pressured to do.
I nerded on this hard, for years. And I finally found a group of economic historians in the UK who modeled industrial-era smokestack dispersion.
And they came to the same conclusion mathematically that I'd come to as an anthropologist, which is: wind and pollution are driving marginalized communities to the east.
I didn't know other failed entrepreneurs, and I thought I was the only loser in the world.
Some of the people said, "I'm a German girl.
I think you do have too much trouble about this flag. "" I think that the artist should be returned to his heritage, i.e., the jungles of Africa, and then he can shovel manure in his artistic way. "" This flag I'm standing on stands for everything oppressive in this system: the murder of the Indians and all the oppressed around the world, including my brother who was shot by a pig, who kicked over his body to 'make sure the nigger was dead.' That pig was wearing the flag.
Thank you, Dread Scott, for this opportunity. "" As a veteran defending the flag, I personally would never defend your stupid ass!
Later, President Bush called the work "disgraceful," which I viewed as a tremendous honor, and Congress outlawed the work. (Laughter) I became part of a Supreme Court case when I and others defied that law, by burning flags on the steps of the Capitol.
This is me at the exact same moment, eight stories above that crowd.
When I was a Child Protective Services worker, I saw things like this all the time.
Now, as social work faculty at Florida State University, I lead an institute that curates the most innovative and effective child welfare research.
I actually started to see some of this growing evolution and awareness myself cropping up all over China.
Secretly, I was terrified.
I stayed in my home for a year, thinking I did something wrong, told myself, "What did you do? What happened?" I stayed silent, while all along, I went outside and smiled. Nobody knew. That's money shame.
I'm that friend.
There was one black professor and one black assistant dean.
Well, today, I'm an executive speechwriter for one of the biggest companies in the world.
As a musician and an engineer, and someone raised in a family of artists, I thought that this idea of musical photographs was really powerful.
But for AIVA, this process is taken from years and years of learning, decades of learning as an artist, as a musician and a composer, down to a couple of hours.
And I couldn't be more proud to show it to you, so if you can, close your eyes and enjoy the music.
As a biologist and a geneticist, it has become my mission to help solve this problem.
I know it sounds nerdy, but you know I'm a scientist.
I'm sure there's a hundred better ones right here in this room.
I'm a psychiatrist who works with pregnant and postpartum women, a reproductive psychiatrist, and in the decade that I've been working in this field, I've noticed a pattern. It goes something like this: a woman calls me up, she's just had a baby, and she's concerned.
I'm a psychiatrist who works with pregnant and postpartum women, a reproductive psychiatrist, and in the decade that I've been working in this field, I've noticed a pattern. It goes something like this: a woman calls me up, she's just had a baby, and she's concerned.
So I go through the symptoms of that diagnosis, and it's clear to me that she's not clinically depressed, and I tell her that.
But she isn't reassured. "It isn't supposed to feel like this," she insists.
She says," I thought motherhood would make feel whole and happy.
If women understood the natural progression of matrescence, if they knew that most people found it hard to live inside this push and pull, if they knew that under these circumstances, ambivalence was normal and nothing to be ashamed of, they would feel less alone, they would feel less stigmatized, and I think it would even reduce rates of postpartum depression.
It is time to ask ourselves, have the assumptions and policies we developed in the wake of those tragic events truly made us more secure? Have they made our societies, both in Europe and in the United States, more resilient? I've worked all my life in the field of security and defense, and I am convinced that now, more than ever, we need to radically reframe the way we think and act about security, and especially about international security.
A confession: I am an archaeologist and a museum curator, but a paradoxical one.
As a college student, all of this was an enigma that was hard to decipher. Why did Native Americans want their heritage back from the very places preserving it?
In 2007, I was hired as a curator at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science.
Spontaneous parties broke out at my house every night for weeks. I was fed. I was entertained. It was great. But that kind of enthusiasm is sort of hard to sustain over the long term, and eventually it petered down to just one friend, who would send me jokes during the day and come and keep me company in the evenings — someone I got to know a whole lot better during this period of convalescence.
That was 21 years ago, and for 19 of those years, I have been married to that marvelous introvert who never in a million years would have approached me under other circumstances.
We have a wonderful 14-year-old daughter, who did all my illustrations. (Cheers and applause) Yeah.
As a storyteller, I've always been fascinated with the idea of recreating this notion of choices in fiction.
Her daughter's been taken hostage by an android, and of course, she's in a state of shock.
I'm the android sent by CyberLife.
So that gives you an idea of what my work is about as an interactive writer.
Where a linear writer needs to deal with time and space, as an interactive writer, I need to deal with time, space and possibilities.
I am convinced that in the coming years, we will see more and more moving and meaningful interactive experiences, created by a new generation of talents.
My local TV station reported live from outside the hospital of a Cambridge scientist who was in a coma, and they didn't know if she would live or die or walk or talk.
I'm an immunologist, and by using what I know about our body's defense system, I was able to identify key players in our fight to build back our cuts and bruises.
Questioning a nurse a day later, she said to me, "Oh, you're talking about the threesome."
Actually, as a teenage photojournalist when I met the trio, I saw their behavior as a mirror to the fears of exclusion and desires for intimacy that I also carried.
I related to their invisibility, which pained me during my childhood but has become my greatest asset as an immersive documentarian, because I can just fade into my empathy.
Before shooting this series, I was also in love with two different people who knew about each other, being the object over which they fought.
I love infographics. As an information designer, I've worked with all sorts of data over the past 25 years.
These two Kenyan ladies were best friends from neighboring villages, but they'd stopped seeing each other, literally, for 10 years, because both had gone blind from a curable condition called cataracts.
Fortunately for Mama Jane and her friend, a donor had provided treatment so that we could take them to the nearest hospital three hours away.
But in that very same clinic, I met Theresa, a shy young woman who couldn't look me in the eyes, not because she couldn't see, but the appearance of the growth on her eyes called pterygium meant she'd lost her confidence, and with it, her place in her community.
She had no prospects for marriage or children and had been completely ostracized.
I resisted it for as many years as I could because as the only brown boy in the school, I already felt like a chocolate chip in rice pudding, and the idea of looking more different was not particularly appealing.
When eventually I was persuaded to go, the optometrist fitted me with the trial lenses and was shocked at just how poor my sight was.
I went from a failing child at school who was constantly told I was lazy and not paying attention to suddenly being a child with opportunity and potential.
This deep sense of injustice drove me to become a doctor, eventually an eye surgeon, and in 2012, my wife and I packed our bags and moved to Kenya to try and give something back.
Inspired by the challenges I'd had as a child, we equipped teachers, 25 of them, with smartphones to screen children in schools.
We've had incredible commitments of 200 million pairs of glasses to the fund and millions of dollars, so that the dynamic and individual needs of people — like my own issues that I had as child, and like Theresa, who just required simple surgery — can be met.
So, as a child, I used to spend all of my time at my great-grandmother's house.
I cannot tell you or describe to you how outraged, mad and angry I was.
I myself was a victim of sexual assault, back many decades ago, when I was in law school.
I was even more horrified to learn — if I could be more horrified — that the oldest of those kits — one of the oldest of those kits — belonged to an eight-year-old girl.
She was grabbed from behind, and she felt what she thought was a gun, in her side.
In fact, I thought I was so brilliant that I not only got rather lazy with studying the game, but I also got more risky, started playing in the biggest tournaments I could against the very best in the world.
For 20 years, I've been obsessed with one question: What do we, what do all of us need in order to be healthy?
One of those white Republican women in Charlotte was a waitress struggling to stay awake with an enormous Big Gulp soda. She just looked exhausted. And she was. She told us that she worked two jobs but still could not afford a membership to the Y, but it was OK that she couldn't go to the gym, she said, because she also could not afford gas and walked 10 miles to and from work every single day.
And my family survived, but we teetered, down one paycheck, relying on my mom's schoolteacher salary.
Even as a little kid, I knew we lived in the shadow of financial and emotional collapse.
The bulla had worked. It had protected him. Unlike many others, he had survived to become an adult.
But in other ways, Lucius is still a child.
But one day, she meets a girl named Onion.
Onion looks gorgeous in her bright purple jacket, and she smells terrific.
The professor and the janitor take the lantern and cross together.
This takes them ten minutes since the janitor has to slow down for the old professor who keeps muttering that he probably shouldn't have given the zombies night vision.
But remember, the lab assistant has been waiting on the other side, and she's the second fastest of the group.
The tallest captive sees three black hats in front of him, so he says "black," telling everyone else he sees an odd number of black hats.
Prisoner two also sees an odd number of black hats, so she knows hers is white, and answers correctly.
Prisoner three sees an even number of black hats, so he knows that his must be one of the black hats the first two prisoners saw.
Prisoner four hears that and knows that she should be looking for an even number of black hats since one was behind her.
The first prisoner has a 50% chance of giving a wrong answer about his own hat, but the parity information he conveys allows everyone else to guess theirs with absolute certainty.
I'm just going to keep — yeah, thanks, mom. (Applause) She's also one of the most extraordinary people I know, beyond being a wonderful musician.
A few weeks ago, I met a colleague whose mom was diagnosed with incurable cancer, and she said, "Niels, it's hard.
Instead of playing with the grandchildren, she now has to travel three times a week two hours up and down to Amsterdam just to get her treatment and tests. "And that really breaks my heart, because we all know that a professional nurse could draw her blood at home as well, right?
Dr. Covinsky, a clinical researcher at the University of California, he concludes that a third of patients over 70 and more than half of patients over 85, leave the hospital more disabled than when they came in.
A friend of mine, Art, he recently needed to be hospitalized for just a minor surgery, and he had to stay in the hospital for over two weeks, just because he needed a specific kind of IV antibiotics.
And one of them started crying — her name is Yahara. She started crying. I said, "Why are you crying?" She said, "I'm crying because I had come to believe — always seeing us represented as poor people — I had come to believe that maybe, yes, maybe we are inferior.
I'm an accounting professor, and I do fraud research.
But if I'm being completely honest with myself, I am really conflicted with this message that I'm sending to my students.
So how can I, as a professor who really cares about her students encourage them to become whistle-blowers, when I know how the world truly feels about them?
Now, when she was contacted by this reporter, her identity was known. She was exposed. And when she was exposed, she received a demotion, death threats, over collegiate sports.
I mean, these political movements have built their success with ideas that could mean, down the road, losing my French citizenship because I'm North African or not being able to come back home to the US because I come from a Muslim-majority country.
It showed another fascinating finding: 71 percent of the world population agreed with the statement, "I am a citizen of the world." Do you know what it means?
I am a shopaholic —
You see, I'm a global solutions director for top-tier retail, and we were in a meeting with one of my largest customers, discussing how to streamline costs.
I was horrified. I'm like, "Of all people, I should be able to help prevent this."
In 2013, I was an executive at an international engineering firm in San Francisco.
As a white, cisgendered woman in the United States, there are many ways I'm very privileged.
It was heartbreaking to see my dad, this strong, athletic, energetic guy, lying in the bed with electrodes strapped to his bare chest.
Steve, a physician, told me about a doctor that he worked with who was never very respectful, especially to junior staff and nurses.
Steve, a physician, told me about a doctor that he worked with who was never very respectful, especially to junior staff and nurses.
I'd been brought in to the company because I was a seasoned expert in my field, but in this particular room, I felt like a newbie amongst the tech geniuses.
I fancied myself a modern Margaret Mead amongst the millennials, and I quickly learned that I had as much to offer them as they did to me.
Here's how the alchemy worked for me at Airbnb: I was assigned a young, smart partner, who helped me develop a hospitality department.
Early on, Laura Hughes could see that I was a little lost in this habitat, so she often sat right next to me in meetings so she could be my tech translator, and I could write her notes and she could tell me, "That's what that means." Laura was 27 years old, she'd worked for Google for four years and then for a year and a half at Airbnb when I met her.

Laura was 27 years old, she'd worked for Google for four years and then for a year and a half at Airbnb when I met her.
At Airbnb, I also learned as a modern elder that my role was to intern publicly and mentor privately.
I was slightly rattled, I was pretty rattled, but I tried not to let it bother me too much because I knew that all the hardest climbing was up at the top.
This time I popped over the edge shirtless, panting, jacked.
I was amped, but nobody batted an eye.
I looked like a lost hiker that was too close to the edge. I was surrounded by people talking on cell phones and having picnics.
This is a photo of my friend Conrad Anker climbing up the bottom of El Cap with an empty backpack.
We spent the day climbing together to a specific crack in the middle of the wall that was choked with loose rocks that made that section difficult and potentially dangerous, because any missed step might knock a rock to the ground and kill a passing climber or hiker.
After all, I was the so-called expert there, the former 20-year television news anchor and life and business coach.
My manipulative, jealous, stalker ex-boyfriend did exactly what he said he would do: he put up a website with my name on it, and he posted this. And this. And several explicit photos that he had taken of me while I was asleep, living with him in Jamaica.
For women under the age of 30, that number looks like one in 10. And that leaves a few of you in this audience as potential victims. You want to know what's even more alarming?
It was this toy called a Pleo that I had ordered, and I was really excited about it because I've always loved robots.
Although since then I've become a mother, nine months ago, and I've learned that babies also squirm when you hold them upside down. (Laughter) But my response to this robot was also interesting because I knew exactly how this machine worked, and yet I still felt compelled to be kind to it.
And then I say I'm also a musician — they're like, "Yeah, we know."
And that's what I was wondering last fall when I was working at U of T's planetarium, and I was contacted by an artist named Robyn Rennie and her daughter Erin.
And Robyn was so moved by this presentation that when she went home, she painted this gorgeous representation of her experience.
As both a researcher who studies differences in how individuals' brains wire and rewire themselves, and as a Touretter with other related diagnoses, I have long been fascinated by failures of self-regulation on the impulsive and compulsive behavioral spectrums.
Do you know why I became a neuroscientist?
I know someone who overdosed, who was revived by Narcan, and she was mostly angry that she wasn't simply allowed to die.
I was the navigator on board, and one evening, after a long session analyzing weather data and plotting our course, I came up on deck and saw this beautiful sunset.
Belle Gibson was a happy young Australian.
But Belle was determined.
She'd been a fighter her whole life.
And girls are telling me that they're especially worried about their futures.
That's the number of women who were married before their 18th birthday.
Six hundred and fifty million. And many were mothers while they were still children themselves.
This is the way that they then can see themselves in jobs that are in engineering, in science, and maybe in the space program.
And in this program, girls who have been studying computer skills and the STEM program have a chance to work side by side with young professionals, so that they can learn firsthand what it's like to be an architect, a designer or a scientist.
And when you see these girls, smiles on their faces, the hot lights in their eyes, they are so excited, they have hope for the future.
We have been called the Indians
We have been called Native American
We have been called pagan
What? You were hoping for Peter Parker? The Avengers? You don't expect this beacon of diversity, these good-looking, nicely dressed dudes just oozing charisma to solve the issues?
What? Dude, no, I'm just making slides. I'm a consultant. I make slides. I'm making PowerPoint slides, I'm not looking —
As a new parent, I tell you, I am troubled by devastating images of young children being ripped out of the arms of their parents at the US border and being placed in private detention facilities that did too little to help the kids maintain contact with their parents.
So who was Thucydides? He was the father and founder of history.
So as we saw with this flipping the pyramid of poverty, China has actually soared. It's meteoric. Former Czech president, Vaclav Havel, I think, put it best. He said, "All this has happened so fast, we haven't yet had time to be astonished."
The most ambitious and most competent leader on the international stage today is Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Four years ago, Senator John McCain asked me to testify about this to his Senate Armed Services Committee.
And he would scratch his head and certainly say he couldn't think of more colorful provocateur than North Korea's Kim Jong-un.
And I think now we need a surge of imagination, creativity, informed by history, for, as the philosopher Santayana reminded us, in the end, only those who refuse to study history are condemned to repeat it.
I have had hundreds of encounters. They have taught me something important that I want to share with you. I was born in Turkey from Kurdish parents and we moved to Denmark when I was a young child.
In 2007, I ran for a seat in the Danish parliament as one of the first women with a minority background. I was elected, but I soon found out that not everyone was happy about it as I had to quickly get used to finding hate messages in my inbox.
Several weeks later I was at a friend's house, and I was very upset and angry about all the hate and racism I had met.
Even our prejudices were alike. (Laughter) Ingolf told me that when he waits for the bus and the bus stops 10 meters away from him, it was because the driver was a "raghead." I recognized that feeling. When I was young and I waited for the bus and it stopped 10 meters away from me, I was sure that the driver was a racist.
As a young child, I hated different population groups.
They have formed me as a democratic citizen and a bridge builder.
Maybe at this point, do you think I am an idealist?
And let me end by quoting my friend, Sergeot Uzan, who lost his son, Dan Uzan, in a terror attack on a Jewish synagogue in Copenhagen, 2015.
It wasn't until after I committed to this project that I realized I had it all wrong.
And sometimes, these filters aren't just removing the specific content, but it could also lead to loss of your linked accounts: your email address, your documents, your photos, or your unfinished book, which happened with the writer Dennis Cooper.
The result is important, but whatever happens, I'm pretty sure it will be followed by many other similar proposals around the world.
During my daily regular job as a web developer, I didn't have the feeling that I'm working on something that had a chance to be a bigger than me.
So a friend of mine was riding in a taxi to the airport the other day, and on the way, she was chatting with the taxi driver, and he said to her, with total sincerity, "I can tell you are a really good person." And when she told me this story later, she said she couldn't believe how good it made her feel, that it meant a lot to her.

And when she told me this story later, she said she couldn't believe how good it made her feel, that it meant a lot to her.
Now that may seem like a strong reaction from my friend to the words of a total stranger, but she's not alone.
I'm a social scientist. I study the psychology of good people, and research in my field says many of us care deeply about feeling like a good person and being seen as a good person.
This work on bounded rationality is what's inspired work I've done with my collaborators Max Bazerman and Mahzarin Banaji, on what we call bounded ethicality.
Like, for example, when I got an email from a female student in my class saying that a reading I had assigned, a reading I had been assigning for years, was sexist.
Well, let me introduce you to my friend Cayla.
When we confronted the company that made and programmed Cayla, they issued a series of statements that one had to be an IT expert in order to breach the security. Shall we fact-check that statement and live hack Cayla together? Here she is. Cayla is equipped with a Bluetooth device which can transmit up to 60 feet, a bit less if there's a wall between.
So in 2005, I was a development executive at Leonardo's production company.
For example, a comedy about a high school senior, who, when faced with an unplanned pregnancy, makes an unusual decision regarding her unborn child.
Surely, there was some unwritten Hollywood rule of omertà that had guided people away from doing that before that I was simply too naive to understand, it being so early in my career.
I was sure I was going to get fired, and so I decided that day that A: I would never tell anybody that I had done this, and B: I would never do it again.
That our onscreen heroes have to conform to a very narrow idea about beauty that we consider conventional. What does that mean when those images are projected 30 feet high and the lights go down, for a kid that looks like me in Columbus, Georgia? Or a Muslim girl in Cardiff, Wales?

I was fascinated by this weird conception: viruses curing an infection.
To this day, I am fascinated by the medical potential of phages.
This is a picture of Félix d'Herelle. He is one of the two scientists credited with discovering phages.
He was interested in a disease called bacillary dysentery, which is a bacterial infection that causes severe diarrhea, and back then, was actually killing a lot of people, because after all, no cure for bacterial infections had been invented.
Well, we weren't as smart as we thought we were.
A number of clinical trials are getting underway in Europe and the US. So I'm convinced that we're standing on the verge of a renaissance of phage therapy.
That's an interesting idea. "(Laughter) Now I'm a writer, and for my books I like to go on adventures.
But I loved talking to this inventor, Doug Fleming, because he was so passionate.
Because I am terrified. "But we made it. And I met the farmers, the Guarnizo brothers.
Because I am terrified. "But we made it. And I met the farmers, the Guarnizo brothers.
I'm still a selfish bastard a huge amount of the time. But I'm better than I was before this project.
Now, I'm an accelerator physicist, so I design particle accelerators, and I try and understand how beams behave.
When that same person challenged my ideas, it felt terrible, I felt humiliated and ashamed.
Professor Juliana Schroeder at UC Berkeley and her colleagues have research that suggests that listening to someone's voice as they make a controversial argument is literally humanizing.
In my book, though, I argue that the first modern crisis of civility actually began about 500 years ago, when a certain professor of theology named Martin Luther took advantage of a recent advancement in communications technology, the printing press, to call the Pope the Antichrist, and thus inadvertently launch the Protestant Reformation.
or that's what she said, she was really proud of me — and so she would give me a hug, and I'm pretty sure she had her phone up and she was thinking, "Oh, is John from Harvard still single?"
Or that's what she said, she was really proud of me — and so she would give me a hug, and I'm pretty sure she had her phone up and she was thinking, "Oh, is John from Harvard still single?"
So I told you. But I really was conflicted, right?
There's a lot of talk in Silicon Valley that says, "Let's celebrate failure." No, I don't know if we would go all the way there, because like, in our board meetings, our board members are never like, "Hey, Chieh, you failed last quarter, keep doing that, buddy, OK?" No one's ever said that.
In my job as a technology advisor, I've seen so many companies make the well-meaning decisions to put huge investments into technology, only to have the benefits fail to live up to the expectation.
Now, he told me that he'd always felt overwhelmed by his job, but it wasn't until our conversation that he thought it might be because of the technologies he was overseeing.
A colleague of mine took a ride in a Lyft in Atlanta last year, and he started chatting with his driver about libraries, as we do.
And in the past few years, I myself have paid over 500 dollars in late fines.
And I have been fortunate enough to be able to pay that 500 dollars over the last several years.
As Michael might have mentioned, I've been a librarian for 15 years and my mom hasn't been in a library in decades, because when she was young, she lost a book.
As a bioethicist, a lawyer, a philosopher and an Iranian-American, I'm deeply concerned about what this means for our freedoms and what kinds of protections we need.
What you're seeing is my brain activity when I was relaxed and curious.
This may all sound great, and as a bioethicist, I am a huge proponent of empowering people to take charge of their own health and well-being by giving them access to information about themselves, including this incredible new brain-decoding technology. But I worry. I worry that we will voluntarily or involuntarily give up our last bastion of freedom, our mental privacy.
Is it so far-fetched to imagine a society in which people are arrested based on their thoughts of committing a crime, like in the science-fiction dystopian society in "Minority Report." Already, in the United States, in Indiana, an 18-year-old was charged with attempting to intimidate his school by posting a video of himself shooting people in the hallways... Except the people were zombies and the video was of him playing an augmented-reality video game, all interpreted to be a mental projection of his subjective intent.
I don't know about you, but when I was little, story time was always one of my favorite parts of the day.
Sophie pretends to be ill so she doesn't have to go to school.
And her teacher can't understand why she's so far behind with her schoolwork.
And her teacher can't understand why she's so far behind with her schoolwork.
I was dishonest, and I paid the penalty.
Before that, I'd been a practicing solicitor for 30 years.
Storybook Dads began in 2003, when Sharon Berry, a civilian worker in a prison, realized just how much many prisoners wanted to stay in contact with their children.
As a kid, I looked at them, and I saw everything I wasn't.
They had big muscles, supermodel good looks, and phenomenal cosmic powers. And me? I kind of looked like this, except shorter and with frizzier hair, and I never felt powerful.
And I don't know how much time you've spent with Puerto Rican women from the Bronx, but we're also some of the world's greatest storytellers.
The funny, the goofy, the gentle — those were my in to storytelling, so much so that I wrote a young-adult novel called "Juliet Takes a Breath," about a chubby, queer Puerto Rican girl from the Bronx navigating sexuality, family and identity.
She's tough, Latina, and she's so strong that she can punch portals into other dimensions.
See, because her moms had sacrificed themselves to the universe when she was a kid, and she'd been on her own ever since.
But see, I didn't come to all this compassion and healing stuff like, you know, out of nowhere, and so when it came to America's story, I wanted to give her the space to be human, to mess up, and to find soft on her own.
Because where else would she feel safe and represented and liberated but a university dedicated to the first Puerto Rican woman nominated to the Supreme Court of the United States?
And her first class is "Intergalactic Revolutionaries and You," and America is so excited, she's ready to show off her strength, she's ready to show off her portal-punching skills,
But I didn't want America to be alone for long, and so in a homework assignment gone totally wrong, she lands on a battlefield with the X-Men.
So obviously, I had to crash-land a grandma on America Chavez, and not just any grandma — a big, strong, luchador grandma, one that loved her enough to take her to the ancestral plain, where America Chavez could see the history of her people play out in the skies above.
And even that, that justified act kind of wrecks her a little bit, so I made sure that she linked up with her best friend, and they talk feelings and they go on a road trip and they sing "Just a Girl" by No Doubt at the top of their lungs.
And even that, that justified act kind of wrecks her a little bit, so I made sure that she linked up with her best friend, and they talk feelings and they go on a road trip and they sing "Just a Girl" by No Doubt at the top of their lungs.
I talked about this in front of an environmentalist just the other day, and she said, "Why are you defending humans?
Personal seed capital, a publicly established baby trust, what my colleague William Darity at Duke University and I have referred to as baby bonds, a term that was coined by the late historian from Columbia University, Manning Marable.
Indeed, I'm a university professor.
I'm a meteorologist by degree, I have a bachelor's, master's and PhD in physical meteorology, so I'm a meteorologist, card carrying.
But admittedly, I'm a weather geek.
But he was a climate skeptic.
And so I woke up one morning, and there was this question in my mind, "Greg, are you engaging in confirmation bias?
Are you only looking for information to support what you already think? "And if I was honest with myself, and I tried to be
Maybe there was still a doubt as to how much, but to say "nothing" was not a responsible thing for me to do as a scientist or a person.
One of my favorite senior clients — we'll call her Jane — is a poster child for what's old-fashioned in leadership today.
Never let 'em see you sweat, always have an answer. [The Way We Work] My name is Dan, I'm a partner at a global creative consultancy.
Personally, I'm taking all of this as a call to be the ally who, like my boss did for me, lets people know that it's OK to open up.
For example, my friend Lisa, she cuts her hair a certain length, so she feels the vibrations of sound in the music.
Please do not trouble me when I am focused.
I was the first-ever data analyst at Interscope Records.
I been so pressed that I don't even know
The US President, who was caught on tape talking about how he can grab women's body parts wherever he wants, however he wants, can call a survivor a liar at one of his rallies, and the crowds will roar.
And I've read article after article bemoaning... wealthy white men who have landed softly with their golden parachutes, following the disclosure of their terrible behavior.
But be clear: This is a movement about the one in four girls and the one in six boys who are sexually assaulted every year and carry those wounds into adulthood.
It's about the 60 percent of black girls like me who will be experiencing sexual violence before they turn 18, and the thousands and thousands of low-wage workers who are being sexually harassed right now on jobs that they can't afford to quit.
He was born enslaved, his parents were enslaved, and he had no reason to believe that a black man in America wouldn't die a slave.
And yet, legend has it that when he was freed by his enslavers, he walked from Georgia to South Carolina so that he could find the wife and child that he was separated from.
Wasn't he afraid that he would be captured and killed by white vigilantes, or he would get there and they would be gone? "And so I asked my grandmother once why she thought that he took this journey up, and she said," I guess he had to believe it was possible. "
In 2006, 12 years ago, I laid across a mattress on my floor in my one-bedroom apartment, frustrated with all the sexual violence that I saw in my community.
I was mildly interested in meeting him. It was kind of cool. I was more intrigued by the fact that he lived in a mansion, because I watched a lot of "General Hospital" and "Dynasty" as a child. (Laughter) And so I got up that morning, ready to go to visit the governor.
Because, you see, I didn't just want to open the gates for young black women who had been underestimated and told they don't belong.
I wanted to open those gates as an ally of the LGBTQ community.
Just a few. But in the pursuit, I became the first black woman to ever become the nominee for governor in the history of the United States of America for a major party.
One day, she saw an article in a newspaper about another domestic worker with a really similar story to hers, another case that I was working on at the time, and she found a way to reach me.
As you go about your day and you encounter these moral choices, think of Lily. Think like Lily. Think like a domestic worker who shows up and cares no matter what.
Show up like a domestic worker, because our children are counting on us.
And to be honest, for many years, my answer would be," I don't know.
I mean, who wants to read about Jose asking about the directions to the train station. Right? I wanted to read "Harry Potter" instead, because that was my favorite book as a child, and I have read it many times.
He was one of the worst students in class.
As a language mentor, I help people learn languages by themselves, and I see this every day.
This polluter sent us this specific image, asking us that these are all bags filled with PM 2.5, and can we recycle it for him if we paid him some money.
Bertha, Eldra Jr., Taydama and Eldra III. That's me. My father was a Vietnam veteran who earned a Purple Heart and made it home to find love, marry, and begin his own brood.
Growing up as a young black male in Sacramento, California in the 1980s, there were two groups I identified as having respect: athletes and gangsters.
One of the best things that happened in my life to that point was being sent to New Folsom Prison.
I was accompanied by skilled facilitators on a journey into the depths of myself to find those wounded parts that not only festered but seeped out to create unsafe space for others.
I stand here today for the first time since I was 14 years old not under any form of state supervision. I'm married to a tremendous woman named Holly, and together, we are raising two sons who I encourage to experience emotions in a safe way.

To Kat and Marie, not having and election website was unacceptable, but they didn't have very many options.They didn't have the budget to hire a web developer, they didn't have the expertise to build a site themselves, so they went without.
Inspired by their experience, we built a website template using research-based best practices in civic design, and developed the training so that Kat and Marie are able to maintain their site themselves.
I am a scientist who is passionate about bubbles.
As a scientist who is passionate about bubbles, I love to see them, I love to play with them, and I love to study them.
I am trained to put out many different types of fires.
But I am not trained to deal with the intricate interaction between first responders, the health care community, social services and the wider community that is necessary to save a life long-term.
The job of a first responder: prevent unnecessary deaths. Period. So... Obviously, I'm a stubborn firefighter and nurse. And I refuse to believe that there isn't a way around every barrier.
The first American woman to become a self-made millionaire: Madam C. J. Walker... The dresses of the first ladies of the United States... Shirley Chisholm, the first woman to seek the US Democratic party's presidential nomination —
As a museum curator, I understand why these stories are so seductive.
Exceptional women are inspiring and aspirational.
If we can collectively apply that radical notion that women are people, it becomes easier to show women as people are: familiar, diverse, present.
Demands for the increase of women's representation does not automatically include Afro-Latinas like me... or immigrant women, or Asian women, or Native women, or trans women, or undocumented women, or women over 65, or girls — the list can go on and on and on.
Demands for the increase of women's representation does not automatically include Afro-Latinas like me... or immigrant women, or Asian women, or Native women, or trans women, or undocumented women, or women over 65, or girls — the list can go on and on and on.
As an Afro-Latina curator, I'm one of very few.
That poem, "Hair," was written and performed by Elizabeth Acevedo, a Dominican-American 2018 National Book Award winner, and it appeared in an award-winning Smithsonian exhibit that I curated.
As a museum curator, I am empowered to change that narrative.
When this work was on view, it was one of our most Instagrammed pieces, and visitors told me they connected with the everyday elements of her brown skin or her rollers or her jewelry.
As a Christian, I believe that God created this incredible planet that we live on and gave us responsibility over every living thing on it.
I'm a Christian, I care about a changing climate because it is, as the military calls it, a "threat multiplier." It takes those issues, like poverty and hunger and disease and lack of access to clean water and even political crises that lead to refugee crises.
I'm not a Rotarian. But when I gave my first talk at a Rotary Club, I walked in and they had this giant banner that had the Four-Way Test on it.
And he said, "You know, I wasn't sure about this whole global warming thing, but it passed the Four-Way Test." (Laughter) (Applause) These values, though — they have to be genuine.
I was giving a talk at a Christian college a number of years ago, and after my talk, a fellow scientist came up and he said, "I need some help.
I'm a climate scientist, so the irony of traveling around to talk to people about a changing climate is not lost on me. (Laughter) The biggest part of my personal carbon footprint is my travel.
ecru... carmine. Now, if you haven't noticed, I am black, thank you —
I was eventually saved by a girl walking near the pool who happened to look down and see me.
And when India's Toni Morrison, the great writer Mahasweta Devi died, our readers found a short story by her as soon as news hit.
Imagine if you're like a young, techie boy in India's Silicon Valley city of Bangalore.
He was convinced he had stories in his mind.
And so I've given some thought about how to build this women's political revolution and that's what I want to talk to you about today. (Cheers) (Applause) The good news is that one thing that hasn't changed in the last century is women's resilience and our commitment to build a better life not only for ourselves, but for generations to come, because I can't think of a single woman who wants her daughter to have fewer rights or opportunities than she's had.
But the amazing thing is, even though my mother's own grandmother could not vote in Texas, because under Texas law, "idiots, imbeciles, the insane and women" were prevented the franchise — just two generations later, my mother, Ann Richards, was elected the first woman governor in her own right in the state of Texas. (Applause and cheers) But you see, when Mom was coming up in Texas, there weren't a lot of opportunities for women, and frankly, she spent her entire life trying to change that.
Economists even estimate that if every single paid working woman took just one day off of work, it would cost the United States 21 billion dollars in gross domestic product.
She took on six men in her primary, she beat them all, she won the general election, and when she goes to Congress in January, she's going to be the first African-American woman ever to serve her district in Washington, D.C. (Applause and cheers) So women are recognizing — this is our moment. Don't wait for permission, don't wait for your turn.
As the late, great Shirley Chisholm said — Shirley Chisholm, the first African-American woman ever to go to Congress and the first woman to run for president in the Democratic party — but Shirley Chisholm said, "If there's no room for you at the table, just pull up a folding chair." And that's what women are doing, all across the country.
Or maybe it's as simple as standing up on the job in support of yourself or your coworkers.

[The Way We Work] Howdy, my name is Matt, and I'm the CEO of Automattic, the company behind WordPress.com, Jetpack and WooCommerce.
Mom was having issues with memory loss and accepting her age. She looked defeated. I tried to make her as comfortable as possible, but when I was at my easel, painting, I would peek over and see her just... there.
Mom, the oldest, at 13, was married off to a complete stranger twice her age.
I was in awe of her focus and determination to succeed at whatever she loved to do.
She felt worthy again, she felt wanted and needed.
This painting is called "The Dressmaker." I remember, as a kid, Mom sewing clothes for the whole family on this massive, heavy sewing machine that was bolted to the floor in the basement.
Our fight lasted less than two minutes, but it was a perfect reflection of the hurricane that was building inside of me as a young survivor of sexual assault and as a girl who was grappling with abandonment and exposure to violence in other spaces in my life.
A teacher broke up the fight and my principal called me in her office.
Believing that a girl is older than she is can lead to harsher treatment, immediate censure when she makes a mistake and victim blaming when she's harmed.
Qualities that are often measured in relation to nonblack girls and which don't take into consideration what's going on in this girl's life or her cultural norms.
Middle school girls are being turned away from school because of the way they wear their hair naturally or because of the way the clothes fit their bodies. High school girls are experiencing violence at the hands of police officers in schools. Where can black girls be black without reprimand or punishment?
In my work as a researcher and educator, I've had an opportunity to work with girls like Stacy, a girl who I profile in my book "Pushout," who struggles with her participation in violence.
She bypasses the neuroscientific and structural analyses that science has to offer about how her adverse childhood experiences inform why she's participating in violence and goes straight to describing herself as a "problem child," largely because that's the language that educators were using as they routinely suspended her.
And as a result, their truancy and suspension rates have improved, and girls are arriving at school increasingly ready to learn because they know the teachers there care about them. That matters.
If we commit to this notion of education as freedom work, we can shift educational conditions so that no girl, even the most vulnerable among us, will get pushed out of school.
Two hundred and fourteen million women in lower-income countries say they want to decide whether and when to become pregnant but aren't using contraception.
Women are vital voices and agents for change on this planet, and yet we're too often missing or even barred from the proverbial table.

She'd come across a few snippets of my memoir, which wasn't even out yet, and she was concerned.
For example: "I have been so many things along my curious journey: a poor boy, a nigger, a Yale man, a Harvard man, a faggot, a Christian, a crack baby, alleged, the spawn of Satan, the Second Coming, Casey." That's just page six.
Her call clarified what I am trying to do with my life and in my work as a writer, which is to send one simple message: the way we're taught to live has got to change.
I was raised there in part by my grandmother who worked as a domestic, and by my sister, who adopted me a few years after our mother, who struggled with mental illness, disappeared.
She was the only other person who seemed as strange as me, beautifully strange, some mix of Blanche DuBois from "A Streetcar Named Desire" and a 1980s Whitney Houston.
It felt as out of the blue to me then as it may to you now.
I was prominent for a 24-year-old: intelligent, I spoke well, dressed decent; I was an upstanding citizen.
I had achieved, by my late 20s, about everything a kid is supposed to achieve.
A respected writer called to stage his own intervention after reading a few early chapters, and he began, much like my mother, "Hey, listen. You've been hired to write an autobiography.
It's a great smackdown of multitasking, isn't it, often attributed to the Roman writer Publilius Syrus, although you know how these things are, he probably never said it.
And if you'd like an example of this, should we go for a less intimidating example than Einstein? OK. Michael Crichton, creator of "Jurassic Park" and "E.R." So in the 1970s, he originally trained as a doctor, but then he wrote novels and he directed the original "Westworld" movie.
I like to think of this great man when he's tired, he's stressed, he's anxious about the reception of his book "The Descent of Man." You or I might log into Facebook or turn on the television.
An angry black woman? Or a crazy white one? You can pick. But in fact, the effect is that when we say what's important to us, which is what anger is conveying, people are more likely to get angry at us for being angry.

I am sick and tired of the women I know being sick and tired.
Growing up, I was very close to my father.
He is a pharmacy doctor, and he sent me to school.
He's a wonderful man and a well-respected community leader.
I was very upset.
I engaged many women and girls to work with me. It was hard. Many of the women working with me had to leave once they got married, because their husbands wouldn't let them work.
One colleague of mine was given away by her family to make amends for a crime her brother had committed.
So I ran for a public office as an independent candidate in Lower Dir in the local elections in 2001.
All these elected women now share, discuss and resolve their problems together.
Let me tell you about two of the women I have been working with: Saira Shams.
You can see, this young lady, age 26, she ran for a public office in 2015 in Lower Dir, and she won.
And another young woman is Asma Gul.
She was unable to run for the public office, so she has become the first female journalist of our region.
That might not come as a surprise to some of you. I look like a woman. I'm dressed like one, I guess.
It's also to illustrate that this is why I am a scientist and not an artist.
And I was five years old in Lynchburg, Virginia, a skinny black kid in a kind of somewhat racist town. And I was trying to figure out what I was going to do with my life.
And as I went on through this journey, my dad, who was a school teacher, he played in a band, he did all these things to make money for my sister and I to take piano lessons and do these different things with education.
And I'm thinking, "OK, bread truck, me delivering bread while my dad's driving the truck." I'm like, "OK, I'm going to be a bread guy now." But he says, "This is our camper." I'm like, "Dude, come one, I can read: 'Merita Bread and Rolls' on the side of this truck.
It showed me what it meant to be an explorer, at a very early age.
And I suppressed all that negativity, all that trauma, because I was learning to be an explorer.
And so I knew I could be a chemist. So as I went on this journey through a high school, and I went to college, and I got a football scholarship to play football in college.
And I knew that I could be a chemist, because I'd already blown stuff up.
And this friend of mine said, "Leland, you'd be great astronaut." I just laughed at him, I was like, "Yeah, me, an astronaut?" You know that Neil and Buzz thing from back in '69?
But then, Peggy Whitson, the first female commander, she invited us over to the Russian segment.
My perspective shifted cognitively, it changed me. And when I think about being that little skinny boy, from sometimes racist Lynchburg, Virginia, I would never have had that perspective to think about myself of being an astronaut, if my father hadn't taken us on a journey in this radical craft that we built with our own two hands.
However, standing before you today as a slightly inflated, time-battered version of myself five years later, I'm very confident.
And to help me do that, I'd like to introduce to the stage a very specialist guest from the Queensland Voice Center, a man that's been in my mouth more times than I'd care to admit, a legend of the larynx, ENT doctor and laryngeal surgeon, Matthew Broadhurst.
She's a resident, a surgeon in training.
That'll be up to the attending surgeon, though, but he's not there yet.
But he also knows she ’ d be slower and make more mistakes, and his patient comes first.
And she knows that when she slips up, he’ll tap a touch screen, and she’ll be watching again, feeling like a kid in the corner with a dunce cap.
That’s the kind of future I dreamed of as a kid.
He was just a murderer. Get over it. It was then that I decided to become a silent survivor.
But, surprisingly, he was very calm.
And for two hours, he and I sat there and talked about life, and I got to ask him to forgive me for my hand in his death.
Three months later, he was executed by the State of Mississippi.
And when I talked to him, he was genuinely upset about our decision.
The final juror that I spoke to was Ken.
He said he knew that Bobby was guilty, but the decision he made, he did not know if it was the right decision.
Well, it dawned on me that this child was being raised in the same eye-for-an-eye culture as I was, or had been.
I spoke with Dr. Lori Brotto, a psychologist who treats sexual issues in women, including survivors of trauma
She says the hundreds of women she sees all tend to repeat the same thing. They say, "I don't feel whole." They feel they've lost a connection with their partners and themselves.
And in many ways, although I was a typical 12-year-old girl, my ambivalence about my education led to pretty average grades.
As a former research librarian and an educator, my mother knew that I was capable of accomplishing a lot more.
Now, as a former middle school teacher, I'm not saying that magically everyone is suddenly going to become an A student.
So we have no appointments; she shows up when she wants, but usually waits less than 15 minutes to be seen.
Some people say that I should study to become a climate scientist so that I can "solve the climate crisis." But the climate crisis has already been solved.
You know, I'm a proponent of studying guaranteed income, as one example, conversations about how health care gets provided and other benefits.
She is a hard worker and spent 10 to 12 hours every day rolling bidis.
But deep down, I was sure she wanted to give it a try.
That feeling was very special, because I am not meant to be useful.
As a second daughter of my conservative Indian family, I was fairly clear from a very early age that no one expected anything from me.
I was conditioned to believe that the three identities that defined me — poor village girl — meant that I was to live a life of no voice and no choice.
Will I go to college? "And she would reply back," Try to finish high school first. "I am sure my mother did not mean to discourage me.
My father was confused, my mother was worried — (Applause) My father was confused, my mother was worried, but I felt butterflies in my stomach because I was going to step out of my village for the first time to study in the national capital.
Of the 97 fellows selected that year, I was the only rural college graduate.
I felt alienated, intimidated and judged by many.
Well, six months ago, we had a new joinee. Her name is Kaviarasi.
The best part of her story is that she is now back at Bodhi Tree as a trainer working with dedication to make a change in the lives of others like her.
She's the first in her entire village to attend graduation.
And then there was the hospital that continued to bill a dead man.
This was a grassroots organization, and I was recruited to be a volunteer.
But words can hardly convey my excitement when I was chosen as an early career scientist by Lee Berger, a world-renowned paleoanthropologist, to be one of the primary analysts of recently excavated unpublished fossils.
But words can hardly convey my excitement when I was chosen as an early career scientist by Lee Berger, a world-renowned paleoanthropologist, to be one of the primary analysts of recently excavated unpublished fossils.
The research team that I was invited to join was tasked with describing, comparing and analyzing the fossils, with the difficult goal of identifying to what species the fossils belonged.
And that's also because women are used to taking care of people, so they can manage to take care of their husband with dementia, but the other way around is not so easy for the gentlemen.
Now during medieval times, diseased, dead bodies were sometimes catapulted over walls as an early form of biological warfare, and it's speculated that today, humans are being propelled over the wall as a form of immigration. A ridiculous idea. But the only person ever known to be documented to have launched over the wall from Mexico to the United States was in fact a US citizen, who was given permission to human-cannonball over the wall, 200 feet, so long as he carried his passport in hand
And my thoughts are inspired by a quote by the architect Hassan Fathy, who said, "Architects do not design walls, but the spaces between them." So while I do not think that architects should be designing walls, I do think it's important and urgent that they should be paying attention to those spaces in between.
And then you have me, the teacher, standing there in the corner, like, about to have a panic attack.
So as a classroom teacher, I have to make split-second decisions all the time.
But I do remember hearing, over and over, growing up: there are two things you do not talk about at family get-togethers.
But if a student ever brings something to my attention and I don't know the answer, I will always admit it and own it because I'm not going to pretend to be an expert in something that I don't have experience in or I'm not an authority on.
You are an imposter, and we will remove you. "But I was the only known face of the movement. Why? Because I was the only stupid one.
So it's much easier. When I'm angry at the government, I just make an angry note, and I send it out and thousands of people share it.
But I'm pretty sure we are going to take this in a direction that is very different from what happened at school. So what are the factors of 30?
For example, rich white women are probably much better off in society than poor white men, and rich black men are probably somewhere in between. So it's really more skewed like this, and the same on the bottom level.
For example, I know and I feel that as an Asian person, I am less privileged than white people because of white privilege.
I wonder how you'd feel about someone who thought things like this: "A black or Latino person is less likely than a white person to pay off their loan on time." "A person called John makes a better programmer than a person called Mary." "A black man is more likely to be a repeat offender than a white man." You're probably thinking, "Wow, that sounds like a pretty sexist, racist person," right?
So the AI learns men are more likely to be programmers than women.
And it's a very short leap from there to: men make better programmers than women.
And then they want to put on some music, and maybe order some food, and now, they are barking orders at an obedient female voice assistant.
And yet, they have chosen to create it in the style of 1950s "Mad Man" secretary. Yay!
So, I'm sure in the next couple of days there will be yet another news story about the existential risk, robots taking over and coming for your jobs.
But I feel incredibly positive about this technology.
We need women to be the makers and not just the machines who do the makers' bidding.
Many years ago I was working on Hubble Space Telescope, and a scientist I worked with came to me with some data, and he said, "I think there may be a picture of a planet orbiting another star in this data." We had not had any pictures taken of planets orbiting other stars yet, so if this were true, then this would be the first one and we would be the ones who found it.
I was very excited, so I just dug right into this data.
Well, not to get too technical, but that sucked. (Laughter) I was really unhappy about this.
Lyne steps off the podium. The next guy to come up is a man named Aleksander Wolszczan He takes the microphone and says, "Yeah, so Lyne's team didn't find a pulsar planet, but my team found not just one but two planets orbiting a different pulsar.
